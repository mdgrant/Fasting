	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the gastric emptying of an oral supplement containing carbohydrate plus whey protein drunk before sedation for gastroscopy. METHODS: This is a randomized double-blind trial including adult patients (ages 18-65) with a chief complaint of epigastric burning and who were candidates to elective gastroscopy. After overnight fast subjects were randomized to drink 200 mL of an oral nutritional supplement containing maltodextrine in addition to whey protein 150 to 210 min before the gastroscopy (intervention group, n = 12) or to undergo the endoscopic procedure with no supplement (control group, n = 12). The residual gastric volume (RGV) suctioned and measured during the exam was the main endpoint of the study. RESULTS: There were no complications during all exams. The median (range) fasting time was greater (P < 0.001) in control group (770 min, ranging from 660-917 min) than in the study group (175 min ranging from 150 to 210 min). The median (range) RGV was similar in between the two groups (control group: 25 (10-70) mL versus intervention group: 10 (0-100) mL; p = 0.32). CONCLUSION: Gastric emptying 150-210 min after the ingestion of an oral supplement containing carbohydrate plus whey protein is similar to an overnight fasting condition. Although limited by the number of cases, the sedation for endoscopic procedures is safe with this fasting protocol.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative fasting of patients aims to reduce the residual gastric volume (RGV). The magnitude of this reduction is yet to be ascertained in the Nigerian population. AIM: To compare the RGV and pH of patients fasted for 6-12 h with those allowed oral intake of fluid up to 2 h preoperatively. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This randomized study involved 90 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II patients booked for abdominal myomectomy under general anesthesia. The patients were randomized into three groups. Preoperative fasting from midnight (Group F, n = 30) was fasted from midnight to the operation time. Carbohydrate-rich drink group (Group C, n = 30) received 800 mL of oral carbohydrate solution in the evening before surgery (22:00 h). An additional 400 mL was given 2 h before anesthesia. Placebo drink group (Group P, n = 30) received water in the same protocol as Group C. The Student's t-test was used to analyze RGV and pH postoperative satisfaction and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were compared on a visual analog scale. RESULTS: The RGV and pH were similar for all groups (P = 0.45 and 0.90, respectively). Antiemetic consumption and PONV scores were lower in Group C compared with Groups F and P (P = 0.01). Patients' in Group C had higher satisfaction (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Preoperative carbohydrate or water intake up to 2 h before surgery is safe with better satisfaction when compared to overnight fasting.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: No study so far has tested a beverage containing glutamine 2 h before anesthesia in patients undergoing surgery. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate: 1) the safety of the abbreviation of preoperative fasting to 2 h with a carbohydrate-L-glutamine-rich drink; and 2) the residual gastric volume (RGV) measured after the induction of anesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomies. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial with 56 women (42 (17-65) years-old) submitted to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomized to receive either conventional preoperative fasting of 8 hours (fasted group, n = 12) or one of three different beverages drunk in the evening before surgery (400 mL) and 2 hours before the initiation of anesthesia (200 mL). The beverages were water (placebo group, n = 12), 12.5{\%} (240 mOsm/L) maltodextrine (carbohydrate group, n = 12) or the latter in addition to 50 g (40 g in the evening drink and 10 g in the morning drink) of L-glutamine (glutamine group, n = 14). A 20 F nasogastric tube was inserted immediately after the induction of general anesthesia to aspirate and measure the RGV. RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study. None of the patients had either regurgitation during the induction of anesthesia or postoperative complications. The median (range) of RGV was 6 (0-80) mL. The RGV was similar (p = 0.29) between glutamine group (4.5 {$[$}0-15{$]$} mL), carbohydrate group (7.0 {$[$}0-80{$]$} mL), placebo group (8.5 {$[$}0-50{$]$} mL), and fasted group (5.0 {$[$}0-50{$]$} mL). CONCLUSION: The abbreviation of preoperative fasting to 2 h with carbohydrate and L-glutamine is safe and does not increase the RGV during induction of anesthesia.},

@article{Braga2012,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress due to ischemia/reperfusion injury increases systemic inflammation and impairs immune defenses. Much interest has developed for the administration of antioxidant substrates in surgical patients. The purpose of this study was to perform a pilot evaluation of the impact of a carbohydrate- containing preconditioning oral nutritional supplement (pONS) enriched with glutamine, antioxidants, and green tea extract on postoperative oxidative stress. METHODS: We performed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, involving 36 cancer patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Patients were randomized to receive either pONS or placebo twice the day before surgery and once 3 hours before surgery. Total endogenous antioxidant capacity (TEAC), plasma levels of vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, zinc, F2-isoprostanes, and C-reactive protein were measured at baseline and on postoperative day (POD) 1, 3, and 7. RESULTS: At surgery, the mean gastric residual volume (mL) was 54.2 in the pONS group versus 51.3 in the placebo group (P = NS). On POD 1 plasma levels of vitamin C (P = 0.001), selenium (P = 0.07), and zinc (P = 0.06) were higher in the pONS group compared to placebo. TEAC was improved on POD 1, 3, and 7 in the pONS group compared to placebo (P = 0.01). No difference was found in plasma C-reactive protein levels after surgery in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative pONS administration positively affected plasma vitamin C levels and improved TEAC shortly after surgery, but did not reduce oxidative stress and systemic inflammation markers.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the abbreviation of preoperative fasting with a drink containing glutamine and dextrinomaltose improves organic response to surgical trauma. METHODS: Thirty-six female patients adult (18-62 years) candidates for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly divided into three groups: conventional fasting (fasting group), and two groups receiving two different diets, eight hours (400ml) and two hours before induction of anesthesia (200ml): carbohydrate (CHO) group (12.5{\%} dextrinomaltose) and the glutamine (GLN) group (12.5{\%} dextrinomaltose and 40 and 10g of glutamine, respectively). Blood samples were collected pre and postoperatively. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients completed the study. No pulmonary complication occurred. Gastric residual volume was similar between groups (p = 0.95). Postoperatively, all patients from the fasting group had abnormal glucose (> 110mg/dl), this abnormality being of 50{\%} when compared to the CHO group (p = 0.14), and of 22.2{\%} when compared to the GLN group (p = 0.01). All patients who had the fasting period shortened (CHO + GLN) had normal postoperative insulin, contrasting with 66.7{\%} in the fasted group (p = 0.02). The abnormal sensitivity to insulin postoperatively rose from 32.1{\%} to 46.4{\%} of cases (p = 0.24), and it occurred in only 11.1{\%} of patients in GLN group when compared to 55.5{\%} in the fasting group (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: the abbreviation of preoperative fasting for two hours with dextrinomaltose and glutamine improves insulin sensitivity in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

@article{Gianotti2018,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore whether preoperative oral carbohydrate (CHO) loading could achieve a reduction in the occurrence of postoperative infections. BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia may increase the risk of infection. Preoperative CHO loading can achieve postoperative glycemic control. METHODS: This was a randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label trial. Nondiabetic adult patients who were candidates for elective major abdominal operation were randomized (1:1) to a CHO (preoperative oral intake of 800 mL of water containing 100 g of CHO) or placebo group (intake of 800 mL of water). The blood glucose level was measured every 4 hours for 4 days. Insulin was administered when the blood glucose level was >180 mg/dL. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of postoperative infection. The secondary endpoint was the number of patients needing insulin. RESULTS: From January 2011 through December 2015, 880 patients were randomly allocated to the CHO (n = 438) or placebo (n = 442) group. From each group, 331 patients were available for the analysis. Postoperative infection occurred in 16.3{\%} (54/331) of CHO group patients and 16.0{\%} (53/331) of placebo group patients (relative risk 1.019, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.720-1.442, P = 1.00). Insulin was needed in 8 (2.4{\%}) CHO group patients and 53 (16.0{\%}) placebo group patients (relative risk 0.15, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.07-0.31, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Oral preoperative CHO load is effective for avoiding a blood glucose level >180 mg/dL, but without affecting the risk of postoperative infectious complication.},

@article{Itou2012,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: In many countries, patients are generally allowed to have clear fluids until 2-3 h before surgery. In Japan, long preoperative fasting is still common practice. To shorten the preoperative fasting period in Japan, we tested the safety and efficacy of oral rehydration therapy until 2 h before surgery. METHODS: Three hundred low-risk patients scheduled for morning surgery in six university-affiliated hospitals were randomly assigned to an oral rehydration solution (ORS) group or to a fasting group. Patients in the ORS group consumed up to 1,000 ml of ORS containing balanced glucose and electrolytes: 500 ml between 2100 the night before surgery and the time they woke up the next morning and 500 ml during the morning of surgery until 2 h before surgery. Patients in the fasting group started fasting at 2100 the night before surgery. Primary endpoints were gastric fluid volume and pH immediately after anesthesia induction. Several physiological measures of hydration and electrolytes including the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and the fractional excretion of urea nitrogen (FEUN) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Mean (SD) gastric fluid volume immediately after anesthesia induction was 15.1 (14.0) ml in the ORS group and 17.5 (23.2) ml in the fasting group (P = 0.30). The mean difference between the ORS group and fasting group was -2.5 ml. The 95{\%} confidence interval ranged from -7.1 to +2.2 ml and did not include the noninferior limit of +8 ml. Mean (SD) gastric fluid pH was 2.1 (1.9) in the ORS group and 2.2 (2.0) in the fasting group (P = 0.59). In the ORS group, mean FENa and FEUN immediately after anesthesia induction were both significantly greater than those in the fasting group (P < 0.001 for both variables). The ORS group reported they had been less thirsty and hungry before surgery (P < 0.001, 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Oral rehydration therapy until 2 h before surgery is safe and feasible in the low-risk Japanese surgical population. Physicians are encouraged to use this practice to maintain the amount of water in the body and electrolytes and to improve the patient's comfort.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery is a stress that causes insulin resistance, which leads to an increase in insulin requirement. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a pre-operative oral carbohydrate drink vs. overnight fasting on perioperative insulin requirements in non-diabetic patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. METHODS: One hundred and one patients scheduled for CABG were enrolled in the study. After fasting overnight, the patients were randomised into two groups. In the control group (C), no drink was given in the morning. In the treatment group (T), the patients ingested 400 ml of carbohydrate fluid 2 h before induction of anaesthesia. Blood glucose and insulin requirement was recorded. Gastric drainage was measured. Post-operative nausea and vomiting was recorded. RESULTS: Neither the number of patients requiring insulin nor the amount of insulin required to maintain normoglycaemia differed between the study groups. More patients in the treatment group experienced nausea post-operatively (26 vs. 16, P=0.044), but vomiting was equally common in the study groups (10 vs. 7). Intra-operative gastric drainage was 26.8+/-57.9 ml in the treatment group vs. 16+/-37.9 ml in the control group (NS). CONCLUSION: In this study patient population, a pre-operative oral carbohydrate drink did not reduce post-operative insulin resistance or post-operative nausea and vomiting. According to our findings, it is safe to allow cardiac surgery patients to drink clear fluids up to 2 h before induction of anaesthesia, because gastric emptying of the drink was almost total and no aspiration occurred.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Perioperative aspiration of gastric contents is a rare but serious complication of anaesthesia. Recent fasting guidelines recommend 2 h of fasting for clear fluids before surgery, to avoid aspiration but are often over looked in clinical practice. Our aim is to overcome these issues by using ultrasound to quantify gastric volume as our primary objective. Patients with ASA grade I with age group between 18 and 60 years undergoing elective surgery with general anaesthesia requiring tracheal intubation were randomized in overnight fasting group (group A) and 2-h fasting group with 200 ml of clear apple juice (group B). Ultrasound-guided gastric volume was calculated preoperatively, and gastric pH was measured immediately post-tracheal intubation using pH strip paper. In a total of 60 patients, the mean gastric volume by USG in group A is 29.7 $\pm$8.0 ml and group B is 19.2 $\pm$4.9 ml. The reduced gastric volume in group B is statistically significant (< 0.00001). The mean pH of gastric aspirate in group A is 1.4, and group B is 1.6 with statistically insignificant p value (p < 0.1268) which shows that pH in both the groups was almost same. The mean gastric volume in patients who had 200 ml of clear apple juice 2 h prior (group B) to non-abdominal surgery was lesser than patients who fasted overnight (group A). It supports the fasting guidelines which help in reducing the preoperative discomfort of long fasting hours and dehydration of patients, whereas the mean pH was almost the same for both the groups.

	abstract = {Recent preanesthetic fasting practice allows patients to take clear fluids up to 2 h before surgery without taking any antacid for the prophylaxis of aspiration pneumonia; this practice is defined as oral rehydration therapy (ORT). It has been reported that with ORT the gastric volume may be significantly lower than that with a standard fasting regimen, although in a standard fasting regimen without preanesthetic antacid, gastric pH and volume values could be critical for causing aspiration pneumonia. In this study we compared gastric fluid status in patients with ORT and those with a standard fasting regimen; patients in both groups received a preanesthetic H(2) antagonist. One hundred and four patients were randomly assigned to either the ORT or standard fasting group, and all were given roxatidine 75 mg 2 h before surgery. After the induction of anesthesia, the gastric contents were collected via a gastric tube to measure gastric volume and pH. Neither gastric volume nor pH differed between the groups (ORT 9.6 +/- 8.2 ml and 5.6 +/- 1.7, respectively, vs. standard fasting 8.5 +/- 6.8 ml and 5.5 +/- 1.7, respectively). These data suggest that ORT may not reduce gastric volume in patients receiving a preanesthetic H(2) antagonist.},

@article{Wang2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative oral carbohydrate (POC) has been recommended as an important element of the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol, but its effect on patients undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) remains unclear. Our study aims to investigate the effects of POC for ESD surgery, with particular focus on perioperative well-being and gastric peristalsis. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, and controlled study of patients undergoing ESD was conducted. Seventy-three patients were assigned to 2 groups: experiment (36 patients) and control (37 patients). The experiment group received oral carbohydrate solution 710 mL the night before and 355 mL 2 hours prior to operation. The control group fasted for 10 hours prior to operation. Gastric empty assessment, peristaltic score, and operation score were measured. In addition, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for 6 parameters (thirst, hunger, mouth dryness, nausea, vomit, and weakness) of wellbeing were compared perioperatively. Preoperative basic conditions of patients, postoperative complications, and their clinical outcomes were also recorded. RESULTS: Before anesthesia induction, gastric sonography score was higher in experiment group, while sucked fluid by gastroscopy was similar between 2 groups. And no patient had regurgitation. Moreover, gastric peristaltic score and operation score before operation were both lower in experiment group. Importantly, VAS scores for 3 parameters (thirst, hunger, and mouth dryness) were significantly lower in experiment patients. In addition, clinical outcomes including first time exhaust, first time for drinking water, the usage of hemostasis, postoperative complication, lengths of hospital stay, and in-hospital expense were not significantly different between 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of carbohydrates preoperatively instead of fasting improves the feelings of thirst, hunger, and mouth dryness in patients following ESD surgery without enhancing risk of regurgitation. And, avoiding preoperative fasting with POC can decrease the degree of gastric peristalsis that may facilitate the successful completion of ESD surgery.},

@article{Yagci2008,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite contrary evidence, the practice of overnight fasting before elective surgery maintains its place in tradition. However, prolonged starvation, by its catabolic action, may increase the detrimental effects of surgery. In this study, we evaluated the effects of preoperative carbohydrate loading on the gastric contents of patients and perioperative metabolism. METHODS: Seventy patients scheduled for cholecystectomy or thyroidectomy randomly were assigned to the treatment or control group. Patients in the treatment group (n = 34) received 800 mL of a carbohydrate-rich fluid on the evening before surgery and 400 mL of the same fluid 2 h preoperatively. Conversely, control patients (n = 36) underwent overnight fasting. Plasma glucose and serum insulin levels were obtained across the perioperative period and during anesthesia induction. The volume and pH of preoperative residual gastric contents also were measured. RESULTS: Preoperative plasma glucose levels were found to remain significantly higher in patients who had received the carbohydrate-rich fluid. Serum insulin levels that were elevated initially in the study group returned to control levels by the time of anesthesia induction. There was no statistical difference between the two groups with respect to gastric residue contents or gastric fluid pH. CONCLUSION: The preoperative intake of carbohydrate-rich fluids does not appear to alter the amount or pH of gastric contents, suggesting that this is a safe procedure, in terms of aspiration risk. Furthermore, the intake of such fluid might prevent energy malnutrition.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of oral carbohydrate solution (CHO) on perioperative discomfort, biochemistry, hemodynamics, and patient satisfaction in elective surgery patients under general anesthesia. Sixty cases in ASA I-II group who were planned to have operation under general anesthesia were included in the study. The cases were randomly divided into two groups having 30 subjects in each. The patients in the study group were given CHO in the evening prior to the surgery and 2-3 hr before the anesthesia while routine fasting was applied in the control group. In the study group; 2-3 hr before the surgery; malaise, thirst, hunger, and weakness; just before the surgery malaise, thirst, hunger, and fatigue; 2 hr after the operation thirst, hunger, weakness, and concentration difficulty; 24 hr after the operation malaise and weakness were found significantly lower. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) level was found to be higher in the control group at the 90th min of the operation. Gastric volumes were higher in the control group; gastric pH values were found significantly higher in the study group. The level of anxiety and depression risk rate were found lower in the study group. In conclusion, preoperative CHO reduces perioperative discomfort and improves perioperative well being when compared to overnight fasting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective, randomized, single-blinded study was to compare the effects of a carbohydrate drink 400 mL given 2 h before the surgery with preoperative overnight fasting on the gastric pH and residual volume, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and antiemetic consumption in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II patients who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Randomized, prospective, controlled study, Gulhane Medical Faculty and Guven Hospital Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: Pre-operative carbohydrate drink group (group C, n = 20) and preoperative fasting group (group F, n = 20). Group C was given a 400 mL carbohydrate drink 2 h before to the surgery. The patients of group F were fasted 8 h before the surgery. Both groups were operated under general anesthesia with volatile anesthetics. RESULTS: Hemodynamic parameters, demographic data, gastric acidity and residual volumes were similar for both groups. No complications were observed. PONV and antiemetic consumption was lower in group C compared to group F (P = 0.001). Patient's satisfaction was higher in group C (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that pre-operative carbohydrate drink may be used safely and also improves patient's satisfaction and comfort in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},
