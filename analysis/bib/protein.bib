	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recommended perioperative nutritional interventions may contribute to satisfactory surgical outcomes. Each moment in the course of a surgical pathologic condition may be a window of opportunity for an intervention with a positive impact on postoperative recovery. Based on the idea of accelerating postoperative recovery, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a nutritional intervention with preoperative fasting abbreviation (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery recommendations) on the metabolism of patients undergoing gynecologic surgeries under spinal anesthesia. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was performed at a hospital of medium complexity. After Human Research Ethics Committee approval on August 24, 2015, 80 women who had gynecologic surgery in the period from January to June 2016 and signed the consent form were randomly allocated into two groups: a control group (n = 42) and a juice group (n = 38). They received 200 mL of inert solution (control group) or liquid enriched with carbohydrate and protein (juice group) 4 h before surgery. The variables studied were serum glucose, insulin, insulin resistance evaluated by the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), C-reactive protein, and albumin in the pre- and postoperative periods. The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 20.0. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in the coefficient of variation for the HOMA-IR index in the control group (17.27{\%}; P < 0.01) compared with the juice group (8.46{\%}; P < 0.05), which remained stable from the pre- to the postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative fasting abbreviation with liquid containing carbohydrate and protein before gynecologic surgeries may provide metabolic stability with lower variation in insulin resistance than inert solution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein-containing liquids may delay gastric emptying and increase risk of aspiration. Commercial whey protein nutritional drinks (WPNDs) are advertised as "clear liquid nutritional drinks" and can be mistaken for protein-free, carbohydrate-based clear liquids. We used gastric ultrasonography to compare gastric emptying of a protein-free, carbohydrate-based clear liquid with that of a WPND in healthy volunteers. METHODS: We recruited 19 adult (age >/=18 years) volunteers with a body mass index less than 40 kg/m2 and without a history of diabetes mellitus, dysphagia, prior gastric surgery, or allergy to the ingredients of apple juice (AJ) or a WPND. After fasting for eight hours, the volunteers randomly received 474 mL of AJ or a WPND. Gastric ultrasonographic measurements were obtained at baseline and at 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after ingestion of the liquid. RESULTS: We enrolled 19 volunteers. At 120 minutes after consumption, volunteers who ingested a WPND had a larger estimated gastric volume (GV) than volunteers who ingested AJ (median {$[$}interquartile range{$]$}, 101.3 {$[$}70.0-137.4{$]$} vs. 50.6 {$[$}43.9-81.8{$]$} mL; P=.08). By using the 2-sample t test and an alpha level of .05, we determined that the study had 40{\%} power to detect a significant difference in GV. Future studies need to include 24 participants per group to detect a significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: Although consumption of a WPND was associated with a larger estimated GV in this pilot study, a larger study is necessary to conclude whether patients must fast longer than two hours after consumption of a WPND.},

	abstract = {Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) with sole carbohydrate (CHO) loading and postoperative early oral feeding (POEOF) shortened the length of postoperative (PO) hospital stays (LPOHS) without increasing complications. This study aimed to examine the impact of ERAS with preoperative whey protein-infused CHO loading and POEOF among surgical gynecologic cancer (GC) patients. There were 62 subjects in the intervention group (CHO-P), which received preoperative whey protein-infused CHO loading and POEOF; and 56 subjects formed the control group (CO), which was given usual care. The mean age was 49.5 +/- 12.2 years (CHO-P) and 51.2 +/- 11.9 years (CO). The trial found significant positive results which included shorter LPOHS (78.13 +/- 33.05 vs. 99.49 +/- 22.54 h); a lower readmission rate within one month PO (6{\%} vs. 16{\%}); lower weight loss (-0.3 +/- 2.3 kg vs. -2.1 +/- 2.3 kg); a lower C-reactive protein-albumin ratio (0.3 +/- 1.2 vs. 1.1 +/- 2.6); preserved muscle mass (0.4 +/- 1.7 kg vs. -0.7 +/- 2.6 kg); and better handgrip strength (0.6 +/- 4.3 kg vs. -1.9 +/- 4.7 kg) among CHO-P as compared with CO. However, there was no significant difference in mid-upper arm circumference and serum albumin level upon discharge. ERAS with preoperative whey protein-infused CHO loading and POEOF assured better PO outcomes.},

@article{Marquini2020a,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: to investigate the effects of preoperative fasting abbreviation, a recommendation of Postoperative Accelerated Total Recovery protocol (ACERTO protocol), on postoperative symptoms of patients undergoing gynecological surgeries. METHODS: a double-blind randomized controlled study of 80 gynecological surgeries performed from January to June 2016. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups: Controle Group, with 42 patients, and Juice Group, with 38 patients, who received 200ml inert solution or 200ml carbohydrate- and protein-enriched liquid, respectively, four hours before surgery. The postoperative symptoms studied were thirst, hunger, pain, agitation, satisfaction, and well-being in both groups. To measure the intensity of symptoms, we used the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), associated with the Facial Scale (FS) for pain, applied ten hours after surgery. RESULTS: patients in the Juice Group had less pain (3.51x1.59), thirst (3.63x0.85), hunger (3.86x2.09), and agitation (2.54x0,82) in relation to the Controle Group (P<0.05). Satisfaction (6.89x8.68) and well-being (5.51x7.12) variables were higher (P<0.05) when the carbohydrate- and protein-containing liquid (Juice Group) was ingested in relation to the inert solution (Controle Group). CONCLUSION: the abbreviation of preoperative fasting with carbohydrate- and protein-containing liquid before gynecological surgeries reduces thirst, hunger, pain, agitation, and favors greater satisfaction and well-being than inert solution ingestion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-operative carbohydrate loading has been shown to reduce pre-operative discomfort and postoperative nausea and vomiting in general surgical patients. Few studies have considered day-case surgery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective randomised study was to determine whether pre-operative carbohydrate loading enhanced recovery after day-case cholecystectomy. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Secondary care in a district general and a university hospital in Finland between 2013 and 2016. PATIENTS: A total of 113 patients American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II aged 18 to 70 undergoing day-case cholecystectomy were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were bleeding or coagulation disorders, BMI more than 40 kg m, dementia, insulin-treated diabetes, migraine, Meniere's disease or a history of alcohol or drug abuse. INTERVENTION: The carbohydrate-rich drink group received oral carbohydrate (200 ml) 2 to 3 h before surgery, and the control (fasting) group fasted from midnight according to standard protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to score six forms of discomfort: the need for analgesia and antiemetics, the time to drinking, eating and first mobilisation after surgery and the time to discharge. Any hospital re-admission was also recorded. RESULTS: The highest VAS scores were seen for mouth dryness and tiredness 2 h after surgery in the fasting group. There were no significant differences in any VAS scores between the study groups. No differences in time to mobilisation, need for pain or antiemetic medication or time to discharge were seen between the groups. CONCLUSION: Compared with overnight fasting, pre-operative carbohydrate loading did not significantly enhance peri-operative well being or recovery in patients undergoing day-case cholecystectomy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance after surgery hampers recovery. Oxidative stress is shown to be involved in the occurrence of postoperative insulin resistance. Preoperative carbohydrate-rich oral nutrition supplements reduce but do not prevent insulin resistance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a carbohydrate-, glutamine-, and antioxidant-enriched preoperative oral nutrition supplement on postoperative insulin resistance. METHODS: A double-blind randomized controlled pilot study in 18 patients with rectal cancer, who received either the supplement (S) or the placebo (P) 15, 11, and 4 hours preoperatively, was conducted. Insulin sensitivity was studied prior to surgery and on the first postoperative day using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic 2-step clamp. RESULTS: Hepatic insulin sensitivity (insulin-mediated suppression of glucose production) decreased significantly after surgery in both groups, with no differences between the groups. Peripheral insulin sensitivity (glucose rate of disappearance, Rd) was significantly decreased after surgery in both groups (S: 37.2 {$[$}19.1-50.9{$]$} vs 20.6 {$[$}13.9-27.9{$]$}; P: 23.8 {$[$}15.7-35.5{$]$} vs 15.3 {$[$}12.6-19.1{$]$} micromol/kg.min) but less pronounced in the supplemented group (P = .04). The percentage decrease in glucose Rd did not differ between the groups. Adipose tissue insulin sensitivity (insulin-mediated suppression of plasma free fatty acids) decreased to the same extent after surgery in both groups. CONCLUSION: Rectal cancer surgery induced profound insulin resistance, affecting glucose and fatty acid metabolism. The preoperative nutrition supplement somewhat attenuated but did not prevent postoperative peripheral insulin resistance.},

@article{Du2017,
	abstract = {Background: Pre-operative fasting balances safety against patient discomfort. We compared the gastric emptying profiles of a novel clear, high protein drink against a "traditional" clear and a non-clear fluid. Methods: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study with 48 healthy volunteers, eight to 14 yr of age, fasted overnight and without risk factors for abnormal gastrointestinal motility. Subjects were randomized in equal ratio to ingest 296 ml of apple juice, 2{\%} milk or Ensure Clear. The gastric antrum was seen by ultrasound in the right lateral decubitus position at baseline, after ingestion, then every 30 min thereafter until return to baseline or six h. Gastric antral cross-sectional area was measured independently by two anaesthetists, and compared between drinks. Results: Gastric emptying differed between apple juice, 2{\%} milk and Ensure Clear by analysis of co-variance (P<0.0001), and was faster in males than females (P<0.01). The terminal phase however was similar using interval-censored time to gastric emptying in a survival model (P=0.17) or by comparing proportions with empty stomach vs not empty at 90 min (P=1.0), 120 min (P=0.32), 150 min (P=0.11), 180 min (P=0.76) or 210 min (P=1.0). Conclusions: Despite early differences, clearance from the stomach of apple juice, 2{\%} milk or Ensure Clear is similar at the terminal phase, which is the period of greatest relevance to preoperative fasting recommendations. The stomach is essentially clear by 3-3.5 h for all three drinks studied. The differentiation between liquids in current guidelines is not supported by this study.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: - Abbreviation of preoperative fasting to 2 hours with maltodextrin (CHO)-enriched beverage is a safe procedure and may enhance postoperative recovery. Addition of glutamine (GLN) to CHO beverages may include potential benefits to the metabolism. However, by adding a nitrogenous source to CHO beverages, gastric emptying may be delayed and increase the risk of bronchoaspiration during anesthesia. OBJECTIVE: - In this study of safety, we aimed at investigating the residual gastric volume (RGV) 2 hours after the intake of either CHO beverage alone or CHO beverage combined with GLN. METHODS: - We performed a randomized, crossover clinical trial. We assessed RGV by means of abdominal ultrasonography (US) in 20 healthy volunteers (10 males and 10 females) after an overnight fast of 8 hours. Then, they were randomized to receive 600 mL (400 mL immediately after US followed by another 200 mL 2 hours afterwards) of either CHO (12.5{\%} maltodextrin) or CHO-GLN (12.5{\%} maltodextrin plus 15 g GLN). Two sequential US evaluations were done at 120 and 180 minutes after ingestion of the second dose. The interval of time between ingestion of the two types of beverages was 2 weeks. RESULTS: - The mean (SD) RGV observed after 8 hours fasting (13.56+/-13.25 mL) did not statistically differ (P>0.05) from the RGV observed after ingesting CHO beverage at both 120 (16.32+/-11.78 mL) and 180 minutes (14.60+/-10.39 mL). The RGV obtained at 120 (15.63+/-18.83 mL) and 180 (13.65+/-10.27 mL) minutes after CHO-GLN beverage also was not significantly different from the fasting condition. CONCLUSION: - The RGV at 120 and 180 minutes after ingestion of CHO beverage combined with GLN is similar to that observed after an overnight fast.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Enhanced recovery after surgery is increasingly desired nowadays, and preoperative nutrient intake may be beneficial for this purpose. In this study, we investigated whether the intake of preoperative carbohydrate with amino acid (ONS) solution can improve starvation status and lipid catabolism before the induction of anesthesia. METHODS: This randomized, prospective clinical trial included 24 patients who were divided into two groups before surgery under general anesthesia: a control group, comprising patients who fasted after their last meal the day before surgery (permitted to drink only water), and an ONS group, comprising patients who consumed ONS solution 2 h before surgery. Biochemical markers, the respiratory quotient, and psychosomatic scores were assessed at the initiation of anesthesia. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the ONS group showed significantly lower serum free fatty acid levels {$[$}control group: 828 (729, 1004) microEq/L, ONS group: 479 (408, 610) microEq/L, P = 0.0002, median (25th, 75th percentile){$]$} and total ketone bodies {$[$}control group: 119 (68, 440) micromol/L, ONS group: 40 {$[$}27, 64{$]$} micromol/L, P = 0.037{$]$}. In addition, analysis using the Visual Analog Scale showed higher preoperative scores for anxiety, hunger, and thirst for the control group, with no differences in any other measure of subjective well-being between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that preoperative ONS intake improves lipid catabolism and starvation status before the induction of anesthesia. Furthermore, it can provide better preoperative mental health compared with complete fasting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients experience postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Preoperative treatment with carbohydrate solutions seems to improve the course after different types of surgery. This study was undertaken to investigate the potential value of different models for preoperative hydration/nutrition, in addition to our ERAS (enhanced recovery after surgery) protocol. METHODS: Ninety non-diabetic women planned for elective laparoscopic gastric bypass and aged 18-65 years were included. All were on preoperative low-calorie diet (LCD). They were randomized into three arms, either a carbohydrate-rich drink, a protein-enriched drink, or tap water and instructed to drink 800 and 200 mL 16 and 2 h, respectively, prior to operation. Risk factors for PONV were recorded preoperatively. All patients were operated before lunch and received 1500-2000 mL of Ringer-Acetate solution during the 24-30-h postoperative hospital time. Four variables (nausea, pain, tiredness, and headache) were registered on 100-mm visual analog scales six times over 22 h. The need for additional medication was registered. RESULTS: Out of 90 patients, 73 complete datasets were obtained. Nausea peaked at 7 p.m. but with no statistically significant differences between groups for any of the variables. Pain peaked the first 2 h postoperatively, remained longer, and had not returned to baseline values at 6 a.m. the morning after surgery but with no difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Inside our ERAS protocol, additional preoperative carbohydrate- or protein-enriched fluid treatment did not further reduce immediate patient discomfort in laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of preoperative administration of oral carbohydrate (CHO) or oral rehydration solution (ORS). However, the effects of preoperative CHO or ORS on postoperative quality of recovery after anesthesia remain unclear. Consequently, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative CHO or ORS on patient recovery, using the Quality of Recovery 40 questionnaire (QoR-40). METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial included American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1 and 2 adult patients, who were scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure of body surface. Subjects were randomized to one of the three groups: 1) preoperative CHO group, 2) preoperative ORS group, and 3) control group. The primary outcome was the global QoR-40 administered 24 h after surgery. Intraoperative use of vasopressor, intraoperative body temperature changes, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were also evaluated. RESULTS: We studied 134 subjects. The median {$[$}interquartile range (IQR){$]$} global QoR-40 scores 24 h after the surgery were 187 {$[$}177-197{$]$}, 186 {$[$}171-200{$]$}, and 184 {$[$}171-198{$]$} for the CHO, ORS, and control groups, respectively (p = 0.916). No significant differences existed between the groups regarding intraoperative vasopressor use during the surgery (p = 0.475). CONCLUSIONS: Results of the current study indicated that the preoperative administration of either CHO or ORS did not improve the quality of recovery in patients undergoing minimally invasive body surface surgery.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this prospective, randomized, single-blinded study was to compare the effects of preoperative fast for clear fluids on insulin resistance and hemodynamic stability on patient undergoing maxillofacial surgery. METHOD: In this study 20 patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery were randomized into four groups i.e. - group I patients with standard 08 h fasting before anesthesia, group-II patients were given 400 ml and 200 ml of water 08 h and 2 h respectively before anesthesia, group III patients were given 400 ml water with 50 gms of glucose and 40 gm of glutamine 08 h before anesthesia and 200 ml water with 25 gms of glucose and 10 gm of glutamine 2 h before anesthesia, group IV patients were given 400 ml water with 50 gms of glucose 08 h before anesthesia and 200 ml water with 25 gms of glucose 2 h before anesthesia. Blood samples were collected pre-operatively and post-operatively. RESULTS: Overall results suggest that Post-operative insulin resistance was greater in control patients (2.0 {$[$}0.3{$]$}) compared with the other 3 groups (placebo = 1.8 {$[$}0.9{$]$}); glutamine = (1.8 {$[$}0.6{$]$}); carbohydrate = (1.9 {$[$}0.6{$]$}). DISCUSSION: This study shows that shortening of pre-operative fasting time for clear fluids until 2- h prior to anesthesia may induce a favorable environment for the post-operative course. In conclusion, Glutamine with carbohydrate drink can be used safely in surgical patients.},

@article{Nakamura2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative administration of clear fluids by mouth has recently been endorsed as a way to improve postoperative outcomes. A carbohydrate-containing beverage supplemented with electrolytes or proteins may have additional benefits for patients' satisfaction. However, effects on gastric residual, nausea, and emesis and the effectiveness of these beverages for improving patients' hydration status have not been well defined. METHODS: We evaluated changes in gastric volume over time by magnetic resonance imaging, as well as blood glucose levels, before and after administration of 500 mL oral rehydration solution (ORS) containing 1.8{\%} glucose and electrolytes in 10 healthy volunteers. The same volume of an oral nutritional supplement (ONS) containing 18{\%} glucose and supplemental arginine (545 mOsm/kg) was given to the same population using a crossover design. RESULTS: The mean (median, 95{\%} confidence interval) gastric fluid volume at 1 hour after oral ingestion was 55.0 (55.3, 39.0-70.9) mL in the ORS group, whereas 409.2 (410.9, 371.4-447.0) mL in the ONS group (P = 0.0002). The gastric fluid volume of all participants in the ORS group returned to <1 mL/kg at 90 minutes after ingestion, whereas none reached <1 mL/kg at 120 minutes in the ONS group. The ONS group showed a sustained increase in the blood glucose level after ingestion (P < 0.0001 to baseline at 30, 60, 120 minutes), while the ORS group showed an initial increase (P < 0.0001, P = 0.01, P = 0.205 at each time point). CONCLUSIONS: ORS supplemented with a small amount of glucose showed faster gastric emptying, which may make it suitable for preoperative administration. In contrast, ONS supplemented with arginine with a relatively low osmolality was associated with a longer time for gastric emptying, although it showed a sustained increase in blood glucose level.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The addition of glutamine in preoperative drinks may enhance the benefits of carbohydrate alone. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the gastric residual volume after the intake of a beverage containing carbohydrate plus glutamine. METHODS: Eleven healthy volunteers (24-30 years-old) were randomized in a crossover fashion to intake 400 mL (4h before) and 200 mL (2h before) of a beverage containing either 12.5{\%} maltodextrin (carbohydrate group) or 12.5{\%} maltodextrin plus 15 g of glutamine (glutamine group) in two different moments 7 days apart. Magnetic ressonance was performed to measure the gastric residual volume (mL) 120 and 180 minutes after the last ingestion. RESULTS: Gastric residual volume similar to basal condition was found after 2h and 3h of the intake of beverages. There was no difference in the mean +/-SD GRV (mL) found at 120 minutes (carbohydrate group: 22.9+/-16.6 and glutamine group: 19.7+/-10.7) and at 180 minutes (carbohydrate group: 21.5+/-24.1 and glutamine group: 15.1+/-10.1) between the two drinks. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric emptying is efficient, and occurs in up to two hours after the intake of a beverage containing either carbohydrate alone or carbohydrate associated with glutamine. The addition of glutamine to carbohydrate-enriched drink seems to be safe for the use up to 2h before an operation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the gastric emptying of an oral supplement containing carbohydrate plus whey protein drunk before sedation for gastroscopy. METHODS: This is a randomized double-blind trial including adult patients (ages 18-65) with a chief complaint of epigastric burning and who were candidates to elective gastroscopy. After overnight fast subjects were randomized to drink 200 mL of an oral nutritional supplement containing maltodextrine in addition to whey protein 150 to 210 min before the gastroscopy (intervention group, n = 12) or to undergo the endoscopic procedure with no supplement (control group, n = 12). The residual gastric volume (RGV) suctioned and measured during the exam was the main endpoint of the study. RESULTS: There were no complications during all exams. The median (range) fasting time was greater (P < 0.001) in control group (770 min, ranging from 660-917 min) than in the study group (175 min ranging from 150 to 210 min). The median (range) RGV was similar in between the two groups (control group: 25 (10-70) mL versus intervention group: 10 (0-100) mL; p = 0.32). CONCLUSION: Gastric emptying 150-210 min after the ingestion of an oral supplement containing carbohydrate plus whey protein is similar to an overnight fasting condition. Although limited by the number of cases, the sedation for endoscopic procedures is safe with this fasting protocol.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has been performed after fasting 8 or more hours, which can be harmful to the patients. We assessed comfort, safety and quality of endoscopy under moderate sedation after 2 hours fasting for clear liquids. METHODS: In this clinical trial, patients referred for elective endoscopy were randomly assigned to a fasting period of 8 hours (F8) or a shorter fasting (F2), in which 200 ml of clear liquids were ingested 2 hours before the procedure. Endoscopists blinded to patients fasting status carried out the endoscopies. Comfort was rated by the patients, whereas safety and quality were determined by the endoscopists. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were studied (aging 48.5 +/- 16.5 years, 60{\%} women): 50 patients (51{\%}) in F2 and 48 in F8. Comfort was higher in F2 than F8 in regard to anxiety (8{\%} vs. 25{\%}; P = 0.029), general discomfort (18{\%} vs. 42{\%}; P = 0.010), hunger (44{\%} vs. 67{\%}; P = 0.024), and weakness (22{\%} vs. 42{\%}; P = 0.034). Regurgitation of gastric contents into the esophagus after endoscopic intubation did not differ between F2 and F8 (26{\%} vs. 19{\%}; P = 0.471). There was no case of pulmonary aspiration. Gastric mucosal visibility was normal in most patients either in F2 or F8 (96{\%} vs. 98{\%}; P = 0.999). CONCLUSIONS: Elective upper GI endoscopy after 2 hours fasting for clear liquids was more comfortable and equally safe compared to conventional fasting. This preparation might be cautiously applied for patients in regular clinical conditions referred for elective endoscopy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: SAMMPRIS ClinicalTrial.gov number, NCT01492296.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Prolonged preoperative fasting increases postoperative hospital length of stay and current evidence recommends patients drink a carbohydrate-based liquid drink 2 h before surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the addition of hydrolyzed protein to a carbohydrate-based drink would reduce both the inflammatory response and hospital length of stay. METHODS: We evaluated 22 patients of both sexes, undergoing gastrointestinal resection due to cancer. Patients were randomized into two groups: control group (n = 12; 6-8 h fast) and the intervention group (n = 10; fasted to solids for 6 h; and given a beverage containing 11{\%} pea protein hydrolysate and 89{\%} carbohydrates (79{\%} maltodextrin and 21{\%} sucrose), 400 mL the night before and 200 mL 3 h before surgery. Blood samples were collected the morning before surgery and on postoperative day 2. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 4.5{\%} (one case, control group). The duration of postoperative hospital stay was twofold longer in the control group (P = 0.04). A significant increase of serum C-reactive protein/albumin ratio was observed in controls compared with the intervention group (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The abbreviation of preoperative fasting time to 3 h using a solution containing carbohydrates and hydrolyzed pea proteins reduces the acute-phase inflammatory response and decreases the postoperative length of stay in patients undergoing major surgery for a malignancy.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the abbreviation of preoperative fasting with a drink containing glutamine and dextrinomaltose improves organic response to surgical trauma. METHODS: Thirty-six female patients adult (18-62 years) candidates for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly divided into three groups: conventional fasting (fasting group), and two groups receiving two different diets, eight hours (400ml) and two hours before induction of anesthesia (200ml): carbohydrate (CHO) group (12.5{\%} dextrinomaltose) and the glutamine (GLN) group (12.5{\%} dextrinomaltose and 40 and 10g of glutamine, respectively). Blood samples were collected pre and postoperatively. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients completed the study. No pulmonary complication occurred. Gastric residual volume was similar between groups (p = 0.95). Postoperatively, all patients from the fasting group had abnormal glucose (> 110mg/dl), this abnormality being of 50{\%} when compared to the CHO group (p = 0.14), and of 22.2{\%} when compared to the GLN group (p = 0.01). All patients who had the fasting period shortened (CHO + GLN) had normal postoperative insulin, contrasting with 66.7{\%} in the fasted group (p = 0.02). The abnormal sensitivity to insulin postoperatively rose from 32.1{\%} to 46.4{\%} of cases (p = 0.24), and it occurred in only 11.1{\%} of patients in GLN group when compared to 55.5{\%} in the fasting group (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: the abbreviation of preoperative fasting for two hours with dextrinomaltose and glutamine improves insulin sensitivity in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prolonged preoperative fasting increases insulin resistance (IR). The authors investigated whether an abbreviated preoperative fast with glutamine (GLN) plus a carbohydrate (CHO)-based beverage would improve the organic response after surgery. METHODS: Forty-eight female patients (19-62 years) were randomized to either standard fasting (control group) or to fasting with 1 of 3 different beverages before video-cholecystectomy. Beverages were consumed 8 hours (400 mL; placebo group: water; GLN group: water with 50 g maltodextrine plus 40 g GLN; and CHO group: water with 50 g maltodextrine) and 2 hours (200 mL; placebo: water; GLN: water with 25 g maltodextrine plus 10 g GLN; and CHO: water with 25 g maltodextrine) before anesthesia. Blood samples were collected pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS: The mean (SEM) postoperative homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance was greater (P < .05) in control patients (4.3 {$[$}1.3{$]$}) than in the other groups (placebo, 1.6 {$[$}0.3{$]$}; CHO, 2.3 {$[$}0.4{$]$}; and GLN, 1.5 {$[$}0.1{$]$}). Glutathione was significantly higher (P < .01) in the GLN group than in both CHO and control groups. Interleukin-6 increased in all groups except the GLN group. The C-reactive protein/albumin ratio was higher (P < .05) in controls than in CHO and GLN groups. The nitrogen balance was less negative in GLN (-2.5 {$[$}0.8{$]$} gN) than in both placebo (-9.0 {$[$}2{$]$} gN; P = .001) and control (-6.6 {$[$}0.4{$]$} gN; P = .04) groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative intake of a GLN-enriched CHO beverage appears to improve IR and antioxidant defenses and decreases the inflammatory response after video-cholecystectomy.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In order to enhance postoperative recovery, preoperative consumption of carbohydrate (CHO) drinks has been used to suppress metabolic fluctuations. Trace elements such as zinc and copper are known to play an important role in postoperative recovery. Here, we examined the effects of preoperatively consuming a CHO drink containing zinc and copper. METHODS: Subjects were 122 elective surgery patients divided into two groups (overnight fasting and CHO groups); each group was further divided into morning or afternoon surgery groups. Subjects in the CHO group consumed 300 mL of a CHO drink the night before surgery, followed by 200 ml before morning surgery or 700 ml before afternoon surgery (> or =2 hours before anesthesia induction). Blood levels of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), retinol-binding protein, zinc, and copper were determined. RESULTS: One subject in the CHO group was excluded after refusing the drink. There were no adverse effects from the CHO drink. NEFA levels increased in the fasting groups. Although zinc levels increased in the CHO group immediately after anesthesia induction, no group differences were observed the day after surgery. CONCLUSION: Preoperative consumption of a CHO drink containing trace elements suppressed preoperative metabolic fluctuations without complications and prevented trace element deficiency. Further beneficial effects during the perioperative period can be expected by adding trace elements to CHO supplements.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prolonged preoperative fasting increases insulin resistance and current evidence recommends carbohydrate (CHO) drinks 2 hours before surgery. Our hypothesis is that the addition of whey protein to a CHO-based drink not only reduces the inflammatory response but also diminish insulin resistance. METHODS: Seventeen patients scheduled to cholecystectomy or inguinal herniorraphy were randomized and given 474 ml and 237 ml of water (CO group) or a drink containing CHO and milk whey protein (CHO-P group) respectively, 6 and 3 hours before operation. Blood samples were collected before surgery and 24 hours afterwards for biochemical assays. The endpoints of the study were the insulin resistance (IR), the prognostic inflammatory and nutritional index (PINI) and the C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio. A 5{\%} level for significance was established. RESULTS: There were no anesthetic or postoperative complications. The post-operative IR was lower in the CHO-P group when compared with the CO group (2.75 +/- 0.72 vs 5.74 +/- 1.16; p = 0.03). There was no difference between the two groups in relation to the PINI. The CHO-P group showed a decrease in the both CRP elevation and CRP/albumin ratio (p < 0.05). The proportion of patients who showed CRP/albumin ratio considered normal was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the CHO-P group (87.5{\%}) than in the CO group (33.3{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Shortening the pre-operative fasting using CHO and whey protein is safe and reduces insulin resistance and postoperative acute phase response in elective moderate operations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Supplementing preoperative carbohydrate drinks with glutamine may lead to benefits in addition to reducing insulin resistance, but amino acids may delay gastric emptying (GE). The effects of supplementing a preoperative carbohydrate drink (CCD) with glutamine or lipid on GE were studied. METHODS: Ten healthy male volunteers ingested 410 ml of one of three isocaloric-isovolumetric carbohydrate-based drinks labelled with (99m)Tc-DTPA: CCD (preOp((R)), Nutricia, UK, 50 g carbohydrate), CCD/G (preOp((R)), 36 g carbohydrate + 15 g glutamine) or CCD/L (preOp((R)), 36 g carbohydrate + 7 g lipid) in this randomized, blinded, three-way crossover study. After baseline measurements, GE was measured scintigraphically and blood sampled for insulin, glucose and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) at 20 min intervals for 240 min. RESULTS: Mean (95{\%} CI) T(90) GE times for CCD, CCD/G and CCD/L were 101 (87-115), 95 (84-107) and 87 (72-102) min, respectively. At 40 min postprandially, mean (SEM) concentrations of glucose (mmol/l) and insulin (mIU/l) were 7.5 (0.5) and 35 (5) for CCD; 6.2 (0.2) and 28 (4) for CCD/G; and 7 (0.3) and 31 (5) for CCD/L, respectively. There were no differences in postprandial GLP-1 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Glutamine and lipid supplementation did not prolong the GE of CCD but did 'blunt' postprandial glucose and insulin responses, independent of GLP-1 concentrations.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: No study so far has tested a beverage containing glutamine 2 h before anesthesia in patients undergoing surgery. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate: 1) the safety of the abbreviation of preoperative fasting to 2 h with a carbohydrate-L-glutamine-rich drink; and 2) the residual gastric volume (RGV) measured after the induction of anesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomies. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial with 56 women (42 (17-65) years-old) submitted to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomized to receive either conventional preoperative fasting of 8 hours (fasted group, n = 12) or one of three different beverages drunk in the evening before surgery (400 mL) and 2 hours before the initiation of anesthesia (200 mL). The beverages were water (placebo group, n = 12), 12.5{\%} (240 mOsm/L) maltodextrine (carbohydrate group, n = 12) or the latter in addition to 50 g (40 g in the evening drink and 10 g in the morning drink) of L-glutamine (glutamine group, n = 14). A 20 F nasogastric tube was inserted immediately after the induction of general anesthesia to aspirate and measure the RGV. RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study. None of the patients had either regurgitation during the induction of anesthesia or postoperative complications. The median (range) of RGV was 6 (0-80) mL. The RGV was similar (p = 0.29) between glutamine group (4.5 {$[$}0-15{$]$} mL), carbohydrate group (7.0 {$[$}0-80{$]$} mL), placebo group (8.5 {$[$}0-50{$]$} mL), and fasted group (5.0 {$[$}0-50{$]$} mL). CONCLUSION: The abbreviation of preoperative fasting to 2 h with carbohydrate and L-glutamine is safe and does not increase the RGV during induction of anesthesia.},

@article{Lobo2009,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Preoperative starvation has many undesirable effects but the minimum length of fasting is limited by gastric emptying, which may be dependent on nutrient content, viscosity and osmolarity of the feed. We compared the gastric emptying of two types of preoperative metabolic preconditioning drinks {$[$}Oral Nutritional Supplement (ONS) (Fresenius Kabi, Germany) and preOp (Nutricia Clinical Care, UK){$]$} in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty (10 male, 10 female) healthy adult volunteers were studied on 3 separate occasions in a randomised crossover manner. Volunteers ingested 400 ml preOp, which is a clear carbohydrate drink (CCD) (50 g carbohydrate, 0 g protein), 70 g ONS (50 g carbohydrate and 15 g glutamine) dissolved in water to a total volume of 400 ml (ONS400) and 300 ml (ONS300). Gastric emptying time was measured using magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Mean (95{\%} CI) T(50) and T(100) gastric emptying times for CCD were significantly lower (p<0.001) compared with ONS400 and ONS300. T(50) was 47 (39-55), 78 (69-87) and 81 (70-92)min for CCD, ONS400 and ONS300 respectively. Correspondingly T(100) was 94 (79-110), 156 (138-173) and 162 (140-184)min. Residual gastric volumes returned to baseline 120 min after CCD and 180 min after ONS400 and ONS300. CONCLUSIONS: The faster gastric emptying for CCD compared to ONS400 and ONS300 signifies that gastric emptying may be more dependent on nutrient load than volume or viscosity in healthy volunteers. While it is safe to give CCD 2h preoperatively, ONS400 and ONS300 should be given at least 3h preoperatively.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgery is succeeded by long-lasting state of relative peripheral insulin resistance, which is reduced by giving glucose infusion or oral carbohydrate-rich drinks immediate before operating instead of fasting. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether oral carbohydrate or carbohydrate with peptide drinks preoperatively instead of fasting would improve postoperative voluntary muscle strength, nutritional intake and ambulation, decrease postoperative fatigue, anxiety and discomfort, and reduce the endocrine response to surgery. METHODS: Forty-eight patients were included and randomized into three groups to receive 2 x 400 ml of carbohydrate-rich drinks or to fast overnight and allowed only water. Voluntary grip and quadriceps strength, body composition, pulmonary function, VAS-score of eight parameters of wellbeing, muscle biopsies and insulin, glucagon, IGF-1 and free fatty acids were measured before and after the operation. The basic postoperative regimen for all groups were immediate oral nutrition and early enforced mobilization. RESULTS: Significant postoperative decrease in glycogen synthase activity in the muscle biopsies was reduced in the intervention groups, and in combination, the intervention groups had a less reduced quadriceps strength after one week (-10{\%} vs. -16{\%}, NS) and one month (-5{\%} vs. -13{\%}, P < 0.05). Minor changes in the endocrine response to surgery were found without differences between the groups, and there were no differences between the groups in ambulation time, nutritional intake or subjective measures of wellbeing.},

@article{Blum2019,
	abstract = {Background: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal, standardized approach to the surgical patient that incorporates evidenced-based interventions designed to achieve rapid recovery after surgery by minimizing the patient's stress response. One aspect of ERAS, carbohydrate loading, has been shown in multiple randomized controlled trials to result in postoperative benefits in patients undergoing colorectal surgery, but there appears to be insufficient data to make definitive recommendations for or against carbohydrate loading in joint replacement patients. Objective: To evaluate postoperative nausea and length of stay (LOS) after a preoperative carbohydrate loading protocol was initiated for patients undergoing total joint replacement. Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting and participants: 100 patients who underwent either total knee or hip arthroplasty at Winthrop University Hospital, Mineola, NY, in the past 4 years and either had (n = 50) or had not received preoperative carbohydrate supplements (n = 50). Methods: Using the total joint database, the medical record was reviewed for the patient's demographics, LOS, documentation of postoperative nausea, and number of doses of antiemetic medication given to the patient. Results: The mean LOS for the carbohydrate-loading group and non-carbohydrate group was 1.9 days and 2.6 days. respectively, a difference of 0.70 days (P < 0.0001). The carbohydrate-loaded group received a total of 13 doses of antiemetic medications and the non-carbohydrate group received 21 doses. The average number of antiemetic doses given to a patient postoperatively was 0.26 for the carbohydrate-loaded group and 0.42 for the non-carbohydrate-loaded group. The difference was 0.16 doses (P < 0.7815). Conclusion: The implementation of carbohydrate loading decreased LOS for joint replacement patients by approximately 1 day. Additionally, there was a trend towards decreased antiemetic use and fewer documented cases of postoperative nausea after carbohydrate loading.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative fasting may lead to undesirable effects in the surgical patient in whom there is a stimulus to ingesting clear liquids until 2hours before anesthesia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastric emptying of two different solutions using ultrasound. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, blind study, 34 healthy volunteers ingested 200mL of two solutions without residues in two steps: an isotonic solution with carbohydrates, electrolytes, osmolarity of 292 mOsm.L(-1), and 36 kcal; and other nutritional supplementation with carbohydrates, proteins, electrolytes, osmolarity of 680 mO.L(-1), and 300 kcal. After 2hours, a gastric ultrasound was performed to assess the antrum area and gastric volume, and the relation of gastric volume to weight (vol.w(-1)), whose value above 1.5mL.kg(-1) was considered a risk for bronchoaspiration. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between all parameters evaluated 2hours after the ingestion of nutritional supplementation compared to fasting. The same occurred when the parameters between isotonic solution and nutritional supplementation were compared 2hours after ingestion. Only one patient had vol.w(-1) <1.5mL.kg(-1) 2hours after ingestion of nutritional supplementation; and only one had vol.w(-1)> 1.5mL.kg(-1) after ingestion of isotonic solution. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that gastric emptying of equal volumes of different solutions depends on their constitution. Those with high caloric and high osmolarity, and with proteins present, 2hours after ingestion, increased the gastric volumes, which is compatible with the risk of gastric aspiration.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of preoperative fasting abbreviation with a carbohydrate and protein-enriched solution, on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) incidence in gynecological surgery patients, a population naturally at risk for such unpleasant episodes. METHODS: The present prospective double-blind randomized study was performed at The Hospital Municipal e Maternidade Dr. Odelmo Leao Carneiro (HMMOLC, in the Portuguese acronym), in Uberlandia, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in partnership with the Gynecology Department of the Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of UNIFESP and the board of HMMOLC, and included in the Brazil Platform and in the Brazilian Clinical Trial Registry. After signing the consent form, 80 women, who were submitted to gynecological surgery in the period from January to June 2016, were randomized into 2 groups: control group (n = 42) and juice group (n = 38). They received, respectively, 200 mL of inert solution or liquid enriched with carbohydrate and protein 4 hours presurgery. The incidence, frequency and intensity of PONV were studied using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with statistical analysis performed by the software IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS: The incidence of nausea and vomiting was lower than in the literature, to this population, with 18.9{\%} (14/74) for the control group and 10.8{\%} (8/74) for the juice group, respectively, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION: The incidence of nausea and vomiting was lower than in the literature, but it cannot be said that this is due to the abbreviation of fasting. It can provide greater comfort, with the possibility of PONV prevention in patients at risk for these episodes.},

@article{Riley2015,
	abstract = {Having patients fast for at least 8 hours prior to surgery to decrease aspiration risk continues today in most institutions despite literature supporting the benefits of intake of clear liquids before surgery. National guidelines, in the United States and Europe, recommend an 8-hour fast from fatty foods but allow clear liquids up to 2 hours prior to surgery. This ingestion has been shown to have no effect on residual gastric volume, even in obese patients. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative oral hydration with a commercial, clear-liquid nutritional supplement, Nestl{\'e}'s Breeze (Nestl{\'e}HealthCare Nutrition, Inc., Florham Park, NJ), on the gastric volume and pH of patients awaiting laparoscopic gynecologic surgery, compared to the same effects of standard preoperative fasting. Materials and Methods: For this pilot study, at a tertiary care hospital, 60 patients were studied. Thirty study patients ingested the product and ad libitum clear liquids before surgery and 30 control patients underwent standard preoperative fasting. All of the patients were instructed to take famotidine preoperatively, but some patients did not take this drug. After induction of anesthesia, gastric volume and pH were assessed in all patients. Results: Patients who had ingested the product had a mean gastric volume of 12.4amL with a pH of 3.5 when they received famotidine and 3 when they had not received famotidine, while patients who underwent standard preoperative fasting had a gastric volume of 23.1amL with a pH of 4.1 when they had received famotidine and 1.7 when they had not received famotidine. Conclusions: A clear-liquid nutritional supplement, ingested at least 2 hours prior to laparoscopic surgery, did not increase gastric volume or decrease pH, compared to conventional preoperative fasting and is an efficient way to provide nutrition and hydration to patients prior to laparoscopic surgery.
