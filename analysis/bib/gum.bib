	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the effectiveness of menthol chewing gum, in the relief of the intensity and discomfort of the surgical patient's thirst in the preoperative period. METHOD: a randomized controlled trial, with 102 patients in the preoperative period, randomized in a control group, with usual care, and an experimental group, which received menthol gum, which was the study treatment variable. The primary clinical outcome was the variation in thirst intensity, evaluated by the Numeral Verbal Scale, and the secondary, the variation of the discomfort of thirst, evaluated by the Perioperative Thirst Discomfort Scale. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare measures between groups. The significance level adopted was of 0.05. RESULTS: menthol chewing gum significantly reduced the intensity (p <0.001), with Cohen's medium-effect d, and thirst discomfort (p <0.001), with a large-effect Cohen's d. CONCLUSION: menthol chewing gum was effective in reducing the intensity and discomfort of preoperative thirst. The strategy proved to be an innovative, feasible and safe option in the use for the surgical patient, in the management of the preoperative thirst, in elective surgeries. NCT: 03200197.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Perioperative fasting guidelines differ in their approaches to chewing gum in the preoperative period. Current recommendations range from canceling the surgery to proceeding with it. Given this lack of consensus, we performed gastric ultrasound assessments in healthy volunteers before and after a standardized period of chewing gum. The objective of our study was to determine if chewing gum for 1h change the gastric volume. DESIGN: Observational prospective analytical study. SETTING: Bedside gastric ultrasound. PATIENTS: Following institutional Review Board approval, 55 healthy (American Society of Anesthesiologists class I to II) fasted (non-surgical research) volunteers provided written informed consent to participate in the study. Morbid obesity, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy and previous upper abdominal surgery were exclusion criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Volunteers chewed gum for 1h between the first and second assessment. MEASUREMENTS: Four gastric ultrasound assessments were performed, the first one at baseline and then hourly thereafter. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-five healthy volunteers were studied. The proportion of subjects who presented a completely empty stomach (Grade 0 antrum) was similar at baseline and after 1h of gum-chewing {$[$}81{\%} vs. 84{\%}, p=0.19, CI 95{\%} (-12{\%}, 16{\%}){$]$}. Among those subjects who had visible fluid at baseline, the volume remained unchanged throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: One hour of gum-chewing had no significant effect on the gastric fluid volume of healthy volunteers, suggesting that it may be safe for healthy subjects to chew gum prior to elective surgery.},

@article{Bouvet2017,
	abstract = {Background: Current fasting guidelines allow oral intake of water up to 2 h before induction of anaesthesia. We assessed whether gum chewing affects gastric emptying of 250 ml water and residual gastric fluid volume measured 2 h after ingestion of water. Methods: This prospective randomized observer-blind crossover trial was performed on 20 healthy volunteers who attended two separate study sessions: Control and Chewing gum (chlorophyll flavour, with 2.1 g carbohydrate). Each session started with an ultrasound measurement of the antral area, followed by drinking 250 ml water. Then, volunteers either chewed a sugared gum for 45 min (Chewing gum) or did not (Control). Serial measurements of the antral area were performed during 120 min, and the half-time to gastric emptying (t(1/2)), total gastric emptying time, and gastric fluid volume before ingestion of water and 120 min later were calculated. Results: Gastric emptying of water was not different between sessions; the mean (sdsd) t(1/2) was 23 (10) min in the Control session and 21 (7) min in the Chewing gum session (P=0.52). There was no significant difference between sessions in gastric fluid volumes measured before ingestion of water and 120 min later. Conclusions: Chewing gum does not affect gastric emptying of water and does not change gastric fluid volume measured 2 h after ingestion of water. Clinical trial registration: NCT02673307.},

@article{Shanmugam2016,
	abstract = {The role of preoperative fasting is well established in current anaesthetic practice with different guidelines for clear fluids and food. However, chewing gum may not be categorised as either food or drink by some patients, and may not always be specified in instructions given to patients about preoperative fasting. The aim of this paper was to review anaesthesia incidents involving gum chewing reported to webAIRS to obtain information on the risks, if any, of gum chewing during the preoperative fasting period. There were nine incidents involving chewing gum reported between late 2009 and early 2015. There were no adverse outcomes from the nine incidents other than postponement of surgery in three cases and cancellation in one. In particular, there were no reports of aspiration or airway obstruction. Nevertheless, there were five cases in which the gum was not detected preoperatively and was found in the patient's mouth either intraoperatively or postoperatively. These cases of undetected gum occurred despite patient and staff compliance with their current preoperative checklists. While the risk of increased gastric secretions related to chewing gum preoperatively are not known, the potential for airway obstruction if the gum is not detected and removed preoperatively is very real. We recommend that patients should be specifically advised to avoid gum chewing once fasting from clear fluids is commenced, and that a specific question regarding the presence of chewing gum should be added to all preoperative checklists.},

@article{Goudra2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insufficient fasting prior to endoscopic procedures performed under sedation may result in potential aspiration of gastric contents. Fasting as per ASA guidelines is recommended prior to these procedures. However, the effect of chewing gum on fasting status has been a subject of debate and often leads to procedural delays. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the effect of chewing gum on the gastric volume and pH. METHODS: In this randomized controlled prospective observer blinded trail, ASA I-III patients aged more than 18 years scheduled for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or a combined EGD and colonoscopy under conscious sedation were studied. Patients randomized to the chewing gum group (Group-C) were allowed to chew gum until just before the start of their procedure; the remaining patients were included into Group-NC. After sedation and endoscope insertion, stomach contents were aspirated under vision of a gastroenterologist (blinded to groups). RESULTS: Volume and pH of gastric contents aspirated from 67 patients (34 in Group-C and 33 in Group-NC) were analyzed. The demographic parameters of the groups were comparable. Gastric volume (median-interquartile range) was statistically higher in Group-C (13 ml (7.75-40.75) vs Group-NC 6 ml (1.00-14.00) (P < 0.001){$]$}. The mean pH in both groups was comparable: 2.84 +/- 2.11 in Group-C and 3.79 +/- 2.53 in Group-NC (P = 0.141). CONCLUSION: Although our results show gastric volume in patients chewing gum was statistically higher, clinical relevance of such a small difference is questionable. Thus patients who chewed gum inadvertently prior to procedure should not be denied or delayed administration of sedative and anesthetic medications.},

@article{Schoenfelder2006,
	abstract = {In this study we sought to determine if chewing gum preoperatively increases gastric fluid volume (GFV) and changes gastric acidity. Children, 5-17 yr old, were randomized to one of three groups: a control group that was not given any gum, a group that was given sugarless bubble gum, and a group that was given sugared bubble gum. Patients in the two gum groups were instructed to chew their gum for a period of 30 min. After induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation, the stomach was suctioned with a salem sump orogastric tube. We found that children who did not chew gum had significantly smaller GFV as compared with children who chewed sugared and sugarless gum (0.35 {$[$}0.2-0.5{$]$} mL/kg versus 0.88 {$[$}0.6-1.4{$]$} mL/kg versus 0.69 {$[$}0.4-1.6{$]$} mL/kg; P = 0.0001). Children who did not chew gum also had a significantly lower gastric fluid pH as compared with children chewing sugared and sugarless gum (geometric mean, 1.91 versus 2.25 versus 2.19; P = 0.007). We conclude that children who present for surgery while chewing gum have significantly larger GFV and higher pH.},

@article{Dubin1994,
	abstract = {Patients occasionally arrive in the operating suite chewing gum despite instructions to avoid oral intake for a specific number of hours before surgery. Some anaesthetists are hesitant to proceed with these patients fearing an increase in gastric volume and acidity. This study was undertaken to determine if gum chewing increased gastric volume and acidity. Seventy seven patients were recruited and informed consent obtained. Thirty-one patients who fasted overnight were randomly assigned either to serve as control (Group 1) or to chew sugarless gum prior to anaesthesia (Group 2). The remaining 46 patients fasted overnight but were given sugarless gum and allowed to chew it until immediately before induction of anaesthesia if they desired (Group 3). Volume and pH of gastric content were determined immediately after induction of anaesthesia and tracheal intubation. Results revealed mean values (range) of gastric volume for Group 1-26 ml (9-60), Group 2-40 ml (5-93), and Group 3-28 ml (4-65). Mean values for pH (range) were Group 1-1.8 (1.0-4.6), Group 2-1.6 (1.3-1.9), Group 3-1.7 (1.0-4.4). There was no difference between groups in terms of gastric volume or pH. In addition, there was no relationship between gastric content and the length of time from gum discard to induction or the length of time gum was chewed. In conclusion, the data suggest that induction of anaesthesia is safe and surgery does not need to be delayed if a patient arrives in the OR chewing sugarless gum.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Aspiration of gastric contents is one of the major causes of general anesthesia related morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to compare the effects of using different non-pharmacological preparations pre-operatively on gastric fluid volume and pH. Methodology: This randomized, controlled trial was conducted at a teaching hospital in Shiraz, Southern Iran. Overall, 150 patients were randomly selected from elective surgery candidates, who were 17-95 years old, fulfilled the criteria of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade-I or II, and in which tracheal intubation was indicated. The patients were allocated randomly to one of the following five groups: Group A: continuously chewed bicarbonate-containing gum for 2 hours before anesthesia induction until premedication. Group B: continuously chewed standard sugar free gum 2 hours before anesthesia induction until premedication. Group C: sucked lollipop 2 hours before anesthesia induction. Group D: drank pure water 10 ml/kg 2 hours before anesthesia induction. Group E (control group): without any intervention. Results: The mean volume of gastric fluid was not significantly different among the study groups. In the group who chewed bicarbonate gum, the mean $\pm$SE gastric fluid pH was significantly higher than in other groups {$[$}5$\pm$1 vs. 3$\pm$1 respectively, P<0.001{$]$}. Conclusion: Increased gastric fluid pH following the use of bicarbonate gum for pre-operative preparation may have implications for preventing aspiration and enhancing anesthesia care.},

@article{Soreide1995,
	abstract = {To study the effects on gastric content and subjective well being of chewing gum in the immediate preoperative period, 60 female nonsmokers were randomized to use regular, sugar-free chewing gum preoperatively or to continue the overnight fast. In a similar fashion 44 habitual smokers were randomized to use nicotine gum 2 mg or not. Nonsmokers using chewing gum had significantly larger gastric fluid volumes than controls (mean 30 +/- 19 mL vs 20 +/- 15 mL; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) for difference 1-19 mL; P = 0.03), with no difference in gastric fluid acidity. In smokers, neither gastric fluid volume nor acidity differed significantly between those who were or were not chewing gum. Although the use of nicotine gum in smokers was associated with a reduction in dryness of the mouth, thirst, and irritability, nonsmokers chewing regular gum did not report significant improvements in patient well being. In habitual smokers unable to abstain from nicotine, the use of nicotine gum on the morning of surgery may be beneficial. Although it is difficult to prove a direct influence on the incidence of pulmonary aspiration of increased gastric contents, the fact that regular, sugar-free chewing gum increased gastric fluid volumes probably means that it should not be used on the morning of surgery.},
