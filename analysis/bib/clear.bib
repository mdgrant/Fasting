	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative fasting of patients aims to reduce the residual gastric volume (RGV). The magnitude of this reduction is yet to be ascertained in the Nigerian population. AIM: To compare the RGV and pH of patients fasted for 6-12 h with those allowed oral intake of fluid up to 2 h preoperatively. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This randomized study involved 90 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II patients booked for abdominal myomectomy under general anesthesia. The patients were randomized into three groups. Preoperative fasting from midnight (Group F, n = 30) was fasted from midnight to the operation time. Carbohydrate-rich drink group (Group C, n = 30) received 800 mL of oral carbohydrate solution in the evening before surgery (22:00 h). An additional 400 mL was given 2 h before anesthesia. Placebo drink group (Group P, n = 30) received water in the same protocol as Group C. The Student's t-test was used to analyze RGV and pH postoperative satisfaction and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were compared on a visual analog scale. RESULTS: The RGV and pH were similar for all groups (P = 0.45 and 0.90, respectively). Antiemetic consumption and PONV scores were lower in Group C compared with Groups F and P (P = 0.01). Patients' in Group C had higher satisfaction (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Preoperative carbohydrate or water intake up to 2 h before surgery is safe with better satisfaction when compared to overnight fasting.},

	Abstract = {Background and objectives The current preoperative fasting guidelines allow fluid intake up to 2 hours before surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastric volume of volunteers after an overnight fast and compare it with the gastric volume 2 hours after ingestion of 200 and 500 mL of isotonic solution, by means of ultrasound assessment. Method Eighty volunteers underwent gastric ultrasound at three times: after 8 hours of fasting; 2 hours after ingestion of 200 mL isotonic saline, followed by the first scan; and on another day, 2 hours after ingestion of 500 mL of the same solution after an overnight fast. The evaluation was quantitative (antrum area and gastric volume, and the ratio of participants'gastric volume/weight) and qualitative (absence or presence of gastric contents on right lateral decubitus and supine positions. A p‐value < 0.05 was considered significant). Results There was no difference in quantitative variables at measurement times (p > 0.05). Five volunteers (6.25{\%}) had a volume/weight over 1.5 mL.kg−1 at fasting and 2 hours after ingestion of 200 mL and 6 (7.5{\%}) after 500 mL. Qualitatively, the presence of gastric fluid occurred in more volunteers after fluid ingestion, especially 500 mL (18.7{\%}), although not statistically significant. Conclusion Ultrasound assessment of gastric volume showed no significant difference, both qualitative and quantitative, 2 h after ingestion of 200 mL or 500 mL of isotonic solution compared to fasting, although gastric fluid content has been identified in more volunteers, especially after ingestion of 500 mL isotonic solution.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: No study so far has tested a beverage containing glutamine 2 h before anesthesia in patients undergoing surgery. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate: 1) the safety of the abbreviation of preoperative fasting to 2 h with a carbohydrate-L-glutamine-rich drink; and 2) the residual gastric volume (RGV) measured after the induction of anesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomies. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial with 56 women (42 (17-65) years-old) submitted to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomized to receive either conventional preoperative fasting of 8 hours (fasted group, n = 12) or one of three different beverages drunk in the evening before surgery (400 mL) and 2 hours before the initiation of anesthesia (200 mL). The beverages were water (placebo group, n = 12), 12.5{\%} (240 mOsm/L) maltodextrine (carbohydrate group, n = 12) or the latter in addition to 50 g (40 g in the evening drink and 10 g in the morning drink) of L-glutamine (glutamine group, n = 14). A 20 F nasogastric tube was inserted immediately after the induction of general anesthesia to aspirate and measure the RGV. RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study. None of the patients had either regurgitation during the induction of anesthesia or postoperative complications. The median (range) of RGV was 6 (0-80) mL. The RGV was similar (p = 0.29) between glutamine group (4.5 {$[$}0-15{$]$} mL), carbohydrate group (7.0 {$[$}0-80{$]$} mL), placebo group (8.5 {$[$}0-50{$]$} mL), and fasted group (5.0 {$[$}0-50{$]$} mL). CONCLUSION: The abbreviation of preoperative fasting to 2 h with carbohydrate and L-glutamine is safe and does not increase the RGV during induction of anesthesia.},

@article{Breuer2006,
	Abstract = {In this study we investigated the effects of preoperative oral carbohydrate administration on postoperative insulin resistance (PIR), gastric fluid volume, preoperative discomfort, and variables of organ dysfunction in ASA physical status III-IV patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, including those with noninsulin-dependent Type-2 diabetes mellitus. Before surgery, 188 patients were randomized to receive a clear 12.5{\%} carbohydrate drink (CHO), flavored water (placebo), or to fast overnight (control). CHO and placebo were treated in double-blind format and received 800 mL of the corresponding beverage in the evening and 400 mL 2 h before surgery. Patients were monitored from induction of general anesthesia until 24 h postoperatively. Exogenous insulin requirements to control blood glucose levels <or=10.0 mmol/L were used as a marker for PIR. Gastric fluid volume was measured by passive gastric reflux and preoperative discomfort using visual analog scales. Postoperative clinical and surgical data were recorded. Blood glucose levels and insulin requirements did not differ between groups. Patients receiving CHO and placebo were less thirsty compared with controls (P < 0.01 and P = 0.06, respectively). Ingested liquids did not cause increased gastric fluid volume or other adverse events. The CHO group required less intraoperative inotropic support after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass weaning (P < 0.05). In conclusion, preoperative CHO administration before cardiac surgery does not affect PIR. Clear fluids reduce thirst and may be recommended as a safe procedure in ASA III-IV patients. Further research is indicated to investigate possible cardioprotective effects of preoperative CHO intake.},

@article{Dalal2010,
	Abstract = {Fasting before general anaesthesia aims to reduce the volume and acidity of stomach contents, thus reducing the risk of regurgitation and aspiration. Recent guidelines have recommended a shift in fasting policies from the standard 'nil per oral from midnight' to a more relaxed policy of clear fluid intake a few hours before surgery. The effect of preoperative oral administration of 150 ml of water 2 h prior to surgery was studied prospectively in 100 ASA I and II patients, for elective surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Group I (n = 50) was fasting overnight while Group II (n = 50) was given 150 ml of water 2 h prior to surgery. A nasogastric tube was inserted after intubation and gastric aspirate was collected for volume and pH. The gastric fluid volume was found to be lesser in Group II (5.5 +/- 3.70 ml) than Group I (17.1 +/- 8.2 ml) which was statistically significant. The mean pH values for both groups were similar. Hence, we conclude that patients not at risk for aspiration can be allowed to ingest 150 ml water 2 h prior to surgery.},

@article{De-Silva2009,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Current guidelines for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) advise at least 6-8 h fasting for solids and 4-h fasting for liquids. We aimed to determine whether a 6-h fast for solids and one-hour fast for water prior to UGIE gives good endoscopic vision and less patient discomfort. METHODS: 128 patients referred for UGIE were given a standard meal 6 h before endoscopy, and then randomized to either nil by mouth for 6 h (group A, n = 65) or allowed to drink water for up to one hour prior to endoscopy (group B, n = 63). Before endoscopy patients were requested to indicate discomfort due to fasting on a visual analog scale. Fluid in the gastric fundus was aspirated, when present, for volume and pH measurements, and endoscopic vision was graded. RESULTS: 53 patients in group A and 43 patients in group B completed the study. Discomfort was significantly lower in group B than group A (P < 0.0001). Endoscopic vision was good in all 53 patients in group A and 40 in group B, and average in 3 patients in group B. Fluid in the gastric fundus was noted in 11 patients in group A and 16 in group B, but there were no significant differences in volume or pH between groups. There were no complications attributable to endoscopy in either group. CONCLUSIONS: A 6-h fast for solids and a 1-h fast for water prior to UGIE gives good endoscopic vision, and causes minimum patient discomfort.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prolonged preoperative fasting increases insulin resistance (IR). The authors investigated whether an abbreviated preoperative fast with glutamine (GLN) plus a carbohydrate (CHO)-based beverage would improve the organic response after surgery. METHODS: Forty-eight female patients (19-62 years) were randomized to either standard fasting (control group) or to fasting with 1 of 3 different beverages before video-cholecystectomy. Beverages were consumed 8 hours (400 mL; placebo group: water; GLN group: water with 50 g maltodextrine plus 40 g GLN; and CHO group: water with 50 g maltodextrine) and 2 hours (200 mL; placebo: water; GLN: water with 25 g maltodextrine plus 10 g GLN; and CHO: water with 25 g maltodextrine) before anesthesia. Blood samples were collected pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS: The mean (SEM) postoperative homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance was greater (P < .05) in control patients (4.3 {$[$}1.3{$]$}) than in the other groups (placebo, 1.6 {$[$}0.3{$]$}; CHO, 2.3 {$[$}0.4{$]$}; and GLN, 1.5 {$[$}0.1{$]$}). Glutathione was significantly higher (P < .01) in the GLN group than in both CHO and control groups. Interleukin-6 increased in all groups except the GLN group. The C-reactive protein/albumin ratio was higher (P < .05) in controls than in CHO and GLN groups. The nitrogen balance was less negative in GLN (-2.5 {$[$}0.8{$]$} gN) than in both placebo (-9.0 {$[$}2{$]$} gN; P = .001) and control (-6.6 {$[$}0.4{$]$} gN; P = .04) groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative intake of a GLN-enriched CHO beverage appears to improve IR and antioxidant defenses and decreases the inflammatory response after video-cholecystectomy.},

@article{Ghorashi2014,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fear of aspiration of gastric contents and its life-threatening disadvantages in patients have encouraged many medical practitioners to follow conservative policies for clear fluid/liquid and solid intake from midnight to the time of surgery. These policies have been pursued more severely in case of pregnant women, leading the physicians to follow "nil per os" policy. The aim of this study was to determine and compare the incidence of regurgitation in two groups of pregnant women during general anesthesia for cesarean section, with standard fasting policy and taking clear fluid an hour prior to the induction of anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted for a period of 21 months in Nik-Nafs Maternity Hospital of Rafsanjan. The pregnant women who were candidates for elective cesarean section were registered for the study. All women fasted from midnight, and then were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Those in the case group received 150 ml of clear liquid containing 10{\%} carbohydrate about an hour before the induction of anesthesia. The occurrence of regurgitation was assessed by inserting the turnsole paper into the pharynx. Finally, the data of 411 cases were analyzed by descriptive methods. RESULTS: There was one case of regurgitation (0.69{\%}) in the control group and one case (0.36{\%}) in the case group, and no case of aspiration. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence to suggest that taking clear fluids about 1 hr before cesarean section will increase the risk of regurgitation. It confirms the safety of following more flexible fasting policies preoperatively, in addition to oral fluid intake, in case of parturients.},

	Abstract = {Objectives: Aspiration of gastric contents is one of the major causes of general anesthesia related morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to compare the effects of using different non-pharmacological preparations pre-operatively on gastric fluid volume and pH. Methodology: This randomized, controlled trial was conducted at a teaching hospital in Shiraz, Southern Iran. Overall, 150 patients were randomly selected from elective surgery candidates, who were 17-95 years old, fulfilled the criteria of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade-I or II, and in which tracheal intubation was indicated. The patients were allocated randomly to one of the following five groups: Group A: continuously chewed bicarbonate-containing gum for 2 hours before anesthesia induction until premedication. Group B: continuously chewed standard sugar free gum 2 hours before anesthesia induction until premedication. Group C: sucked lollipop 2 hours before anesthesia induction. Group D: drank pure water 10 ml/kg 2 hours before anesthesia induction. Group E (control group): without any intervention. Results: The mean volume of gastric fluid was not significantly different among the study groups. In the group who chewed bicarbonate gum, the mean $\pm$SE gastric fluid pH was significantly higher than in other groups {$[$}5$\pm$1 vs. 3$\pm$1 respectively, P<0.001{$]$}. Conclusion: Increased gastric fluid pH following the use of bicarbonate gum for pre-operative preparation may have implications for preventing aspiration and enhancing anesthesia care.},

@article{Hausel2001,
	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: We studied the effects of different preoperative oral fluid protocols on preoperative discomfort, residual gastric fluid volumes, and gastric acidity. Two-hundred-fifty-two elective abdominal surgery patients (ASA physical status I-II) were randomized to preparation with a 12.5{\%} carbohydrate drink (CHO), placebo (flavored water), or overnight fasting. The CHO and Placebo groups were double-blinded and were given 800 mL to drink on the evening before and 400 mL on the morning of surgery. Visual analog scales were used to score 11 different discomfort variables. CHO did not increase gastric fluid volumes or affect acidity, and there were no adverse events. The visual analog scale scores in a control situation were not different between groups. During the waiting period before surgery, the CHO-treated group was less hungry and less anxious than both the other groups (P < or = 0.05). CHO reduced thirst as effectively as placebo (P < 0.0001 versus Fasted). Trend analysis showed consistently decreasing thirst, hunger, anxiety, malaise, and unfitness in the CHO group (P < 0.05). The Placebo group experienced decreasing unfitness and malaise, whereas nausea, tiredness, and inability to concentrate increased (P < 0.05). In the Fasted group, hunger, thirst, tiredness, weakness, and inability to concentrate increased (P < 0.05). In conclusion, CHO significantly reduces preoperative discomfort without adversely affecting gastric contents. IMPLICATIONS: Discomfort during the period of waiting before elective surgery can be reduced if patients are prepared with a carbohydrate-rich drink, compared with preoperative oral intake of water or overnight fasting. Visual analog scales can provide useful information about preoperative discomfort in elective surgery patients.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A carbohydrate-rich drink (CHO) has been shown to reduce preoperative discomfort. It was hypothesized that it may also reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). METHODS: Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under inhalational anaesthesia (127 women and 45 men; mean(s.d.) 48(15) years) were randomized to either preoperative fasting, intake of CHO (50 kcal/100 ml, 290 mOsm/kg) or placebo. The non-fasting groups were double-blinded; patients ingested 800 ml of liquid on the evening before surgery and 400 ml 2 h before anaesthesia. Nausea and pain scores on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and episodes of PONV were recorded up to 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: The incidence of PONV was lower in the CHO than in the fasted group between 12 and 24 h after surgery (P = 0.039). Nausea scores in the fasted and placebo groups were higher after operation than before admission to hospital (P = 0.018 and P < 0.001 respectively), whereas there was no significant change in the CHO group. No intergroup differences in VAS scores were seen. The use of anaesthetics, opioids, antiemetics and intravenous fluids was similar in all groups. CONCLUSION: CHO may have a beneficial effect on PONV 12-24 h after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

	Abstract = {Background and Aims: Non-adherence to standard fasting guidelines may result in perioperative complications. We aimed to determine the association between pre-operative over-fasting and post-operative vomiting amongst children undergoing bone marrow aspiration under general anaesthesia. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted from May 2015 to April 2016 in children undergoing bone marrow aspiration under general anaesthesia and their caregivers. Children fasted for >/=3 hours from last clear fluid intake constituted the exposed group (n = 202) while children fasting for <3 h constituted the non-exposed group (n = 202). The primary outcome was the development of post-operative vomiting during the 6 h following induction of anaesthesia. The awareness of the caregiver regarding the importance of keeping the child fasting before anaesthesia was evaluated. Results: The mean (standard deviation) duration time of fasting of the exposed and non-exposed groups were 7.2 (2.4) and 2.2 (0.3) h, respectively. Thirty-two (15.8{\%}) children in the exposed group and 17 (8.4{\%}) children in the non-exposed group developed post-operative vomiting. The relative risk of developing post-operative vomiting amongst over-fasting children was 1.9 (95{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} = 1.1-3.3, P = 0.02), while adjusting to the age, it was 2.1 (95{\%} CI = 1.1-4). Significantly more caregivers were clear about the fasting advice in the non-exposed group than in the exposed group (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Over-fasting is a significant risk factor to develop post-operative vomiting in paediatric anaesthetic practice.},

@article{Klemetti2010,
	Abstract = {Preoperative fasting is considered to be necessary to prevent intraoperative regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents. However, long-lasting preoperative fasting has been shown to have a connection with postoperative problems, such as nausea. Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative nutritional counseling of parents on child's limited preoperative fasting and active preoperative nutrition risks the child's safety in pediatric ambulatory tonsillectomy. Methods: Families, with children 4 - 10 years old, were randomly allocated to the study groups (n= 116; 58/58). The intervention group received verbal and written preoperative counseling on child's active preoperative nutrition, and the control group the current written guidelines. All children were asked to be four hours without solids and two hours without fluids. The children in the intervention group were encouraged to have clear fluids on two occasions. The later portion was two hours preoperatively. Preoperative fasting, surgery, the child's hemodynamic, nausea and vomiting and incidents of aspiration during anesthesia induction and first postoperative oral intake were recorded. Results: The parents in the intervention group followed the guidelines and there were no mistakes such as exceeding fasting time limits. No complications, such as aspiration, occurred though the total preoperative fasting time in the intervention group was significantly shorter (p<.0001) than in the control group. Conclusion: According to the present fasting guidelines in the pediatric ambulatory tonsillectomy, children are advised to fast in fluids for two hours before surgery. However, the children fast significantly longer. Although active counseling on child́s preoperative nutrition increased preoperative oral fluid intake, no complications occurred, and fasting of the child was safely implemented by the parents.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: While carbohydrate loading is an important component of enhanced patient recovery after surgery, no study has evaluated the effects of preoperative carbohydrate loading after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) on patient satisfaction and overall recovery. Thus, we aimed to investigate the impact of preoperative oral carbohydrates on scores from the quality of recovery 40-item (QoR-40) questionnaire after LC. METHODS: A total of 153 adults who underwent LC were randomized into three groups. Group MN-NPO was fasted from midnight until surgery. Group No-NPO received 400 mL of a carbohydrate beverage on the evening before surgery, and a morning dose of 400 mL was ingested at least 2 h before surgery. Group Placebo received the same quantity of flavored water as for group No-NPO. The quality of recovery after general anesthesia was evaluated using QoR-40 questionnaire. Intraoperative hemodynamics were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the groups in terms of the pre- and postoperative global QoR-40 scores (P = 0.257). Group MN-NPO had an elevated heart rate compared to patients who ingested a preoperative beverage (groups No-NPO and Placebo; P = 0.0412). CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative carbohydrate beverage did not improve quality of recovery using the QoR-40 questionnaire after general anesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared to placebo or conventional fasting. However, the preoperative fasting group had a consistently increased heart rate during changes in body position that induced hypotension, which is likely a result of depletion of effective intravascular volume caused by traditional fasting over 8 h.

METHODS: A total of 1599 women were divided into 5 groups according to different preoperative fasting times: group A: solid food >/=8 h; clear fluids >/=6 h; B: solid food >/=8 h; clear fluids >/=2 h < 6 h; C: solid food >/=6 h < 8 h; clear fluids < 2 h; D: solid food >/=2 h < 6 h; clear fluids < 2 h; E: solid food < 2 h; clear fluids < 2 h. RESULTS: Incidence rate of vomiting of women was lower in group C (solid food >/=6 h < 8 h and clear fluids < 2 h) than other groups (P < 0.05). Compared with the fasting for a long time (groups A and B: solid food > 8 h and clear fluids > 2 h at least), the incidence rate of hypoglycemia and acidosis of neonates in group C displayed a certain decrease (P < 0.05). Although shorter fasting times (solid food < 6 h at least) reduced the incidence of hypoglycemia and acidosis in neonates, it increased the risk of vomiting of women. CONCLUSION: The preoperative fasting of solid food >/=6 h < 8 h and clear fluids < 2 h reduces the incidence of vomiting in women's anesthesia and the risk of hypoglycemia and acidosis in neonates.},

@article{Ljunggren2012,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgery induces insulin resistance that might be alleviated by a nutritional drink given preoperatively. The authors hypothesized that some of the beneficial effects of the drink could be attributed to the volume component (approximately 1 L) rather than to the nutrients. METHODS: Sixty patients scheduled for elective total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia were recruited to a clinical trial, and randomly allocated to preoperative fasting, to oral ingestion of tap water, or to oral ingestion of a carbohydrate drink. An intravenous glucose tolerance test calculated glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity on the day before surgery, in the postoperative ward, and on the day after surgery. Other parameters were stress (cortisol in plasma and urine), muscle catabolism (urinary 3-methylhistidine), and wellbeing. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients completed the study. In the postoperative ward, the glucose clearance and the insulin response had decreased from the previous day by 23{\%} and 36{\%}, respectively. Insulin sensitivity did not decrease until the next morning (-48{\%}) and was due to an increased insulin response (+51{\%}). Cortisol excretion was highest on the day of surgery, while 3-methylhistidine increased 1 day later. Follow-up on the third postoperative day showed an average of 1.5 complications per patient. Wellbeing was better 2 weeks after than before the surgery. None of the measured parameters differed significantly between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative ingestion of tap water or a nutritional drink had no statistically significant effect on glucose clearance, insulin sensitivity, postoperative complications, or wellbeing in patients undergoing elective hip surgery.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether, in obese {$[$}body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg.m(2){$]$} patients, oral intake of 300 mL clear liquid two hours before elective surgery affects the volume and pH of gastric contents at induction of anesthesia. METHODS: A single-blind, randomized study of 126 adult patients, age > or = 18 yr, ASA physical status I or II, BMI > 30 kg.m(2) who were scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. Patients were excluded if they had diabetes mellitus, symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, or had taken medication within 24 hr that affects gastric secretion, gastric fluid pH or gastric emptying. All patients fasted from midnight and were randomly assigned to fasting or fluid group. Two hours before their scheduled time of surgery, all patients drank 10 mL of water containing phenol red 50 mg. Those in the fluid group followed with 300 mL clear liquid of their choice. Immediately following induction of general anesthesia and tracheal intubation, gastric contents were aspirated through a multiorifice Salem sump tube. The fluid volume, pH and phenol red concentration were recorded. RESULTS: Median (range) values in fasting vs fluid groups were: gastric fluid volume 26 (3-107) mL vs 30 (3-187) mL, pH 1.78 (1.31-7.08) vs 1.77 (1.27-7.34) and phenol red retrieval 0.1 (0-30){\%} vs 0.2 (0-15){\%}. Differences between groups were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Obese patients without comorbid conditions should follow the same fasting guidelines as non-obese patients and be allowed to drink clear liquid until two hours before elective surgery, inasmuch as obesity per se is not considered a risk factor for pulmonary aspiration.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Living donor pancreas transplantation (LDPT) reduces the number of deaths of diabetic patients on dialysis and of candidates on the waiting lists and helps to overcome the organ shortage. Stringent criteria must be applied to minimize the risk of metabolic complications for living donors. The Japanese Pancreas and Islet Transplantation Association (JPITA) proposed LDPT guidelines in 2010. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated glucose metabolism of the patients who underwent distal pancreatectomy (DP) according to the donor criteria of the LDPT guidelines proposed by the JPITA. METHODS: Fifty-two nondiabetic patients who underwent DP were divided into 2 groups according to the donor criteria: indication group (IG, n = 14) who had age </= 65, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) < 5.9{\%}, and body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m(2). The other patients were placed in the no indication group (NG, n = 38). Clinical data and percent resected volume (PRV) of each pancreas as determined by multi-detector row computed tomography volumetry were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: During the follow-up period (median 12 months), 14 patients (27{\%}) developed new-onset diabetes within a median onset time of 10 months (range 3-24 months) postoperatively. No patient in the IG developed new-onset diabetes. On the other hand, 37{\%} of the patients in the NG developed new-onset diabetes. There were significant between-group differences in changes in preoperative serum fasting glucose and HbA1c levels, whereas there were no significant between-group differences in preoperative serum albumin or body weight. Multivariate analysis identified preoperative HbA1c (odds ratio 51.6, P = .002) and PRV (odds ratio 2.07, P = .033) as independent risk factors for new-onset diabetes. CONCLUSION: Living donor criteria in the LDPT guidelines proposed by the JPITA are appropriate for prevention of glucose metabolic complications in donors. Further long-term follow-up studies of living donors' metabolic function are needed to clarify the safety of the donor.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Surgery induces a catabolic response with stress hormone release and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of pre-operative carbohydrate administration on grip strength, gastrointestinal function and hospital stay following elective colorectal surgery. METHODS: Thirty-six patients undergoing elective colonic resection were randomized into one of three groups. Group 1 were fasted; Group 2 were given pre-operative oral water, Group 3 received equivalent volumes of a Maltodextrin drink. Time to first flatus, first bowel movement and hospital stay were recorded. Muscle strength was measured pre-operatively, and on alternate days thereafter until discharge using a grip strength dynamometer. RESULTS: Patients in the carbohydrate group had a median postoperative hospital stay of 7.5 days compared with 13 days in the water group (P > 0.01) and 10 days in the fasted group (P = 0.06). The median time postsurgery to first flatus was 3 days for both the fasted and water groups compared with 1.5 days in the carbohydrate group (P = 0.13). First bowel movement occurred on day 3 in the carbohydrate group, day 4 in the fasting group and day 5 in the water group. The fasted group showed a significant reduction in postoperative grip strength (P < 0.05) with a median drop of 10{\%} at discharge. Neither the water nor the carbohydrate groups showed significant reductions in muscle strength. CONCLUSION: We found that pre-operative administration of oral carbohydrate leads to a significantly reduced postoperative hospital stay, and a trend towards earlier return of gut function when compared with fasting or supplementary water.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The practice of fasting from midnight prior to surgery is an outdated one. AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of an evidence-based protocol for reduced preoperative fasting on fasting times, patient safety, and comfort. METHODS: A non-randomised case-control study of preoperative fasting times among adult surgical patients undergoing elective procedures was conducted. Consecutive patients were allocated to a reduced preoperative fasting protocol allowing fluids and solids up to 2 and 6 h prior to anaesthesia, respectively (n = 21). These were compared to control patients identified from an historic study of preoperative fasting times who followed the traditional fast from midnight (n = 29). Fasting times and details of patients' subjective comfort were collected using an interview-assisted questionnaire. Incidence of intraoperative aspirations was obtained from anaesthetic records. RESULTS: Significant reductions in fasting times for fluids (p = 0.000) and solids (p = 0.000) were achieved following implementation of the fasting protocol. Less preoperative thirst (0.000), headache (0.012) and nausea (0.015) were reported by those who had a shorter fast. Intraoperative aspiration did not occur in either group. CONCLUSION: Implementation of this protocol for reduced preoperative fasting achieved an appreciable reduction in fasting times and enhanced patient comfort. Patient safety was not compromised. Further modifications of our protocols are necessary to meet the international best practice. We recommend its implementation across all surgical groups in our institution.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carbohydrate-rich liquid drinks (CRLDs) have been recommended to attenuate insulin resistance by shortening the preoperative fasting interval. The aim of our study the effect of preoperative oral administration of CRLDs on the well-being and clinical status of patients. METHODS: A randomized, double blind, prospective study of patients undergoing open colorectal operations (CR) and open cholecyctectomy (CH) was conducted. Patients were divided into three groups: study, placebo, and control. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for seven parameters (thirst, hunger, anxiety, mouth dryness, nausea, weakness and sleep quality) were recorded and compared for two different time periods (up to 24 h postoperatively and from 36 to 48 h postoperatively). The Simplified Acute Physiology Score changes (SAPS)-II between the three groups were also studied. RESULTS: There were 142 patients American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) I or II enrolled in the study (CR = 71 and CH = 71). There were no significant differences in postoperative SAPS-II scores or lengths of hospital stay (LOS) between the groups. However, in CR patients, the degree of thirst was partially improved by drinking CRLDs (P = 0.027). In CH patients, on the other hand, feelings of thirst, hunger, mouth dryness, nausea and weakness showed significant improvement (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oral administration of carbohydrate-rich liquid drinks (CRLDs) improves the well-being in patients undergoing CH, but the effect is less evident in patients undergoing CR. No significant improvements were seen in clinical status or in length of hospital stay in either group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ANZCTR.org.au: ACTRN12614000995673 (registered on 16/09/2014).},

@article{Shi2020,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative insulin resistance (PIR) is a common response after colorectal surgery and an independent risk factor for recovery. Preoperative oral carbohydrate (POC) has been known to reduce PIR. Herein, we investigated whether its mechanism of action involves AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mTOR/S6K1/insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) pathways. METHODS: Patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection were randomly assigned to a POC, fasting, or placebo group. The exclusion criteria were association with diseases or intake of medication affecting insulin sensitivity. Pre- and postoperative insulin resistance, and protein phosphorylation of AMPK, mTOR, and IRS-1 in the rectus abdominis muscle were evaluated. RESULTS: From January 2017 to December 2017, 70 patients were randomized and 63 were evaluated. No difference was found in the clinical and operative characteristics among the 3 groups. In the POC group, the levels of blood glucose, blood insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were significantly lower in the POC group than the fasting and placebo groups, and the insulin sensitivity index was significantly higher. The phosphorylation of AMPK in the POC group was significantly higher than that in the other 2 groups, whereas the phosphorylation of mTOR and IRS-1 was significantly lower. CONCLUSION: PIR involves AMPK and mTOR/S6K1/IRS-1 pathways. POC reduces PIR by the stimulation of AMPK, which suppresses the phosphorylation of mTOR/IRS-1 and attenuates PIR after colorectal resection.},

@article{Singh2015,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting is the most common cause for unexpected hospital admission of patients undergoing day care surgery. Overnight fasting changes patient metabolic state and influences their perioperative stress response. Preoperative carbohydrate loading may have accelerated recovery and better overall outcome after major abdominal surgery. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of preoperative carbohydrate-rich drinks on postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain after day care laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: A total of 120 patients posted for day care laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included in the study and were randomized into three groups. Group A (Cases)-receiving the carbohydrate-rich drink before surgery (CHO), group B (placebo)-receiving the placebo drink before surgery and group C (controls)-fasting from midnight before surgery. Postoperative nausea and vomiting and visual analogue score for pain were noted and analyzed for 24 h. RESULTS: Mean score of nausea in 0-4 h in group A was significantly lower as compared to group B and group C (p = 0.001). Difference in mean score of nausea in 4-12 and 12-24 h between groups was not significant (p = 0.066), (p = 0.257). Mean score of vomiting in 0-4 and 4-12 h in group A was significantly less than that of group B and group C (p = 0.004), (p = 0.001). Mean score of pain in group A was significantly less when compared to group B and group C in 0-4 h (p = 0.001) and 4-12 h (0.005). CONCLUSION: Perioperative consumption of a carbohydrate-rich drink can minimize postoperative nausea, vomiting and pain in patients undergoing outpatient cholecystectomy. Consumption of carbohydrate drinks up to 2 h prior to surgery is not associated with additional complications.},

@article{Wang2010,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative oral carbohydrate (OCH) reduces postoperative insulin resistance (PIR). This randomized trial investigated whether this effect is related to insulin-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB) signalling pathway. METHODS: Patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for elective open resection were randomly assigned to preoperative OCH, fasting or placebo. Preoperative general well-being, insulin resistance before and immediately after surgery, and postoperative expression of PI3K, PKB, protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in rectus abdominis muscle were evaluated. RESULTS: Patient and operative characteristics did not differ between groups. Subjective well-being was significantly better in OCH and placebo groups than in the fasting group, primarily because of reduced thirst (P = 0.005) and hunger (P = 0.041). PIR was significantly greater in fasting and placebo groups (P < 0.010). By the end of surgery, muscle PTK activity as well as PI3K and PKB levels were significantly increased in the OCH group compared with values in fasting and placebo groups (P < 0.050), but GLUT4 expression was unaffected. CONCLUSION: PIR involves the PI3K/PKB signalling pathway. Preoperative OCH intake improves preoperative subjective feelings of hunger and thirst compared with fasting, while attenuating PIR by stimulation of the PI3K/PKB pathway.},

@article{Xue2017,
	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare gastric residual volume (GRV) in patients given a split-dose versus a conventional single-dose of polyethylene glycol (PEG) preparation before undergoing anesthetic colonoscopy. Methods. In a prospective observational study, we assessed GRV in outpatients undergoing same-day anesthetic gastroscopy and colonoscopy between October 8 and December 30 of 2016. Outpatients were assigned to the split-dose (1 L PEG in the prior evening and 1 L PEG 2-4 h before endoscopy) or single-dose (ingestion of 2 L PEG >/= 6 h before endoscopy) regimen randomly. Bowel cleansing quality was assessed with the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). Results. The median GRV in the split-dose group (17 ml, with a range of 0-50 ml; N = 65) was significantly lower than that in the single-dose group (22 ml, with a range of 0-62 ml; N = 64; p = 0.005), with a better bowel cleansing quality (BBPS score 8.05 +/- 0.82 versus 7.64 +/- 1.21; p = 0.028). GRV was not associated with diabetes or the use of medications. Conclusions. GRV after a split-dose preparation and fasting for 2-4 hours is not larger than that after a conventional single-dose preparation and fasting for 6-8 hours. The data indicates that the split-dose bowel preparation might not increase the risk of aspiration.},
