	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review is to quantify potentially preventable patient harm from the frequency, severity, and preventability of the consequences and causes of surgical adverse events to help target patient safety improvement efforts.
DATA SOURCES: Two authors independently reviewed articles retrieved from systematic searches of the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature databases for inclusion and exclusion criteria, methodology, and end points. All retrospective record review studies of adverse events were included. The primary end point was the frequency of general surgery adverse events. The secondary end points were the severity and preventability of consequences and causes.
CONCLUSIONS: Fourteen record review studies incorporating 16,424 surgical patients were included. Adverse events occurred in 14.4% of patients (interquartile range [IQR], 12.5% to 20.1%), and potentially preventable adverse events occurred in 5.2% (IQR, 4.2% to 7.0%). The consequences of 3.6% of adverse events (IQR, 3.1% to 4.4%) were fatal, those of 10.4% (IQR, 8.5% to 12.3%) were severe, those of 34.2% (IQR, 29.2% to 39.2%) were moderate, and those of 52.5% (IQR, 49.8% to 55.3%) were minor. Errors in nonoperative management caused more frequent adverse events than errors in surgical technique.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent consensus statement in Europe has suggested that the fasting time for clear liquid in children can be shortened to 1 hour before a surgery. However, the study to show that 1-hour fasting time for clear fluids is safe in young children is still lacking. This study aimed to investigate the gastric emptying time for carbohydrate-rich drink and regular 5{\%} glucose solution in children aged 3-7 years. METHODS: After overnight fasting, individuals were randomly assigned to ingest 5 mL kg(-1) of either carbohydrate-rich drink or 5{\%} glucose solution. One week later, the same subjects were asked to ingest the other one. Ultrasonography was performed to examine the gastric contents. Gastric antral cross-sectional area was measured, and the gastric fluid volume was calculated before and after fluid ingestion within 120 minutes. The primary outcome was the gastric emptying time for both the clear fluids calculated using the antral cross-sectional area and logarithms of gastric fluid volume. The degrees of thirst and hunger of two drinks were evaluated using a visual analogue scale as the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Data from 16 individuals were analyzed. In the glucose solution group, the antral cross-sectional area and logarithms of gastric fluid volume returned to baseline at 30 minutes after ingestion. However, in the carbohydrate-rich drink group, the median {$[$}interquartile range; range{$]$} antral cross-sectional area (3.69 {$[$}2.64-5.15; 1.83-8.93{$]$} cm(2) vs 2.41 {$[$}2.10-2.96; 1.81-4.37{$]$} cm(2) , P < .001) and mean (95{\%} confidence interval) logarithms of gastric fluid volume (2.54 {$[$}2.30-2.79{$]$} mL vs 2.12 {$[$}1.94-2.30{$]$} mL, P = .048) were still higher than at 60 minutes and returned to the baseline values at 90 minutes after ingestion, respectively. The degree of thirst was lower in the glucose solution group than that in the carbohydrate-rich drink group. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric emptying of carbohydrate-rich drink is slower than that of 5{\%} glucose solution but the residual gastric fluid volume is low one hour after ingestion of 5 mL kg(-1) of either fluid.},

@article{Alimena2020,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Preoperative carbohydrate loading is an effective method to control postoperative insulin resistance. However, data are limited concerning the effects of carbohydrate loading on preoperative hyperglycemia and possible impacts on complication rates. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed of patients enrolled in an enhanced recovery after surgery pathway at a single institution. All patients underwent laparotomy for known or suspected gynecologic malignancies. Patients who had been diagnosed with diabetes preoperatively and those prescribed total parenteral nutrition by their providers were excluded. Data regarding preoperative carbohydrate loading with a commercial maltodextrin beverage, preoperative glucose testing, postoperative day 1 glucose, insulin administration, and complications (all complications, infectious complications, and hyperglycemia-related complications) were collected. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of postoperative infectious complications, defined as superficial or deep wound infection, organ/space infection, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, sepsis, or septic shock. RESULTS: Of 415 patients, 76.9{\%} had a preoperative glucose recorded. The mean age was 60.5+/-12.4 years (range 18-93). Of those with recorded glucose values, 30 patients (9.4{\%}) had glucose >/=180 mg/dL, none of whom were actually given insulin preoperatively. Median preoperative glucose value was significantly increased after carbohydrate loading (122.0 mg/dL with carbohydrate loading vs 101.0 mg/dL without, U=3143, p=0.001); however, there was no relationship between carbohydrate loading and complications. There was a significantly increased risk of hyperglycemia-related complications with postoperative day 1 morning glucose values >/=140 mg/dL (OR 1.85, 95{\%} CI 1.07 to 3.23; p=0.03). Otherwise, preoperative and postoperative hyperglycemia with glucose thresholds of >/=140 mg/dL or >/=180 mg/dL were not associated with increased risk of other types of complications. DISCUSSION: Carbohydrate loading is associated with increased preoperative glucose values; however, this is not likely to be clinically significant as it does not have an impact on complication rates. Preoperative hyperglycemia is not a risk factor for postoperative complications in a carbohydrate-loaded population when known diabetic patients are excluded. PRECIS: While glucose increased with carbohydrate loading in non-diabetic patients, this was not associated with complications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the effects of preoperative carbohydrate-loading (CHO) as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway on patients with/without type II diabetes (DMII). METHODS: Retrospective review of ERAS patients with CHO, including 80 with DMII, 275 without DMII in addition to 89 patients with DMII from the previous (non-ERAS) year. Outcomes included glucose-levels, insulin requirements, and complications. Logistic regression was used to determine the association of any complication with perioperative glucose control variables. RESULTS: Among ERAS versus non-ERAS patients with DMII, there were significant differences in median preoperative (142 mg/dL versus 129.5 mg/dL, p = 0.017) and postoperative day-1 glucose levels (152 mg/dL, versus 137.5 mg/dL, p = 0.004). There were no differences in insulin requirements, hypoglycemic episodes, or complications. Complications were not associated with Hgb-A1C{\%}, home DMII-medications, or preoperative glucose measurement on logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DMII tolerated CHO without increasing insulin requirements or substantially affecting glucose levels or complications.},

@article{Shi2020,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative insulin resistance (PIR) is a common response after colorectal surgery and an independent risk factor for recovery. Preoperative oral carbohydrate (POC) has been known to reduce PIR. Herein, we investigated whether its mechanism of action involves AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mTOR/S6K1/insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) pathways. METHODS: Patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection were randomly assigned to a POC, fasting, or placebo group. The exclusion criteria were association with diseases or intake of medication affecting insulin sensitivity. Pre- and postoperative insulin resistance, and protein phosphorylation of AMPK, mTOR, and IRS-1 in the rectus abdominis muscle were evaluated. RESULTS: From January 2017 to December 2017, 70 patients were randomized and 63 were evaluated. No difference was found in the clinical and operative characteristics among the 3 groups. In the POC group, the levels of blood glucose, blood insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were significantly lower in the POC group than the fasting and placebo groups, and the insulin sensitivity index was significantly higher. The phosphorylation of AMPK in the POC group was significantly higher than that in the other 2 groups, whereas the phosphorylation of mTOR and IRS-1 was significantly lower. CONCLUSION: PIR involves AMPK and mTOR/S6K1/IRS-1 pathways. POC reduces PIR by the stimulation of AMPK, which suppresses the phosphorylation of mTOR/IRS-1 and attenuates PIR after colorectal resection.},

@article{Marquini2020,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recommended perioperative nutritional interventions may contribute to satisfactory surgical outcomes. Each moment in the course of a surgical pathologic condition may be a window of opportunity for an intervention with a positive impact on postoperative recovery. Based on the idea of accelerating postoperative recovery, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a nutritional intervention with preoperative fasting abbreviation (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery recommendations) on the metabolism of patients undergoing gynecologic surgeries under spinal anesthesia. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was performed at a hospital of medium complexity. After Human Research Ethics Committee approval on August 24, 2015, 80 women who had gynecologic surgery in the period from January to June 2016 and signed the consent form were randomly allocated into two groups: a control group (n = 42) and a juice group (n = 38). They received 200 mL of inert solution (control group) or liquid enriched with carbohydrate and protein (juice group) 4 h before surgery. The variables studied were serum glucose, insulin, insulin resistance evaluated by the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), C-reactive protein, and albumin in the pre- and postoperative periods. The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 20.0. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in the coefficient of variation for the HOMA-IR index in the control group (17.27{\%}; P < 0.01) compared with the juice group (8.46{\%}; P < 0.05), which remained stable from the pre- to the postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative fasting abbreviation with liquid containing carbohydrate and protein before gynecologic surgeries may provide metabolic stability with lower variation in insulin resistance than inert solution.},

@article{Popivanov2020,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-operative carbohydrate (CHO) drinks have shown some benefits peri-operatively and have been incorporated into many Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) programmes. We assessed the gastric emptying of pre-operative CHO drinks prior to elective caesarean delivery using ultrasonography. METHODS: After a standard overnight fast, non-labouring pregnant women awaiting elective caesarean delivery underwent a standardised gastric ultrasound assessment at baseline and then every 20min for 2h after consuming 400mL of a CHO drink. The gastric emptying was determined at each time-point both qualitatively and quantitatively. The primary outcome was the time taken for participants to return to a qualitative fasted Perlas grade of 0 or 1. RESULTS: The gastric emptying of 40 participants was analysed. At baseline, all patients had a qualitative grade of either 0 or 1. All patients had returned to either grade 0 or 1 by 100min. At 120min the antral right lateral decubitus (RLD) cross-sectional area (CSA) was 8.03cm(2) (95th percentile; 95{\%} CI 7.4 to 8.3cm(2)) and gastric volume per kg was 1.57mL/kg (95th percentile; 95{\%} CI 1.4 to 2.2). At 120min there was no statistically significant difference from baseline for the RLD CSA (P=0.38) or gastric volume per kg (P=0.27). CONCLUSIONS: The gastric emptying of this cohort of pregnant women suggests that 400mL of a CHO drink can be safely consumed up to two hours before elective surgery. This study can help inform future peri-operative fasting guidelines for pregnant patients.},

Commercial whey protein nutritional drinks (WPNDs) are advertised as "clear liquid nutritional drinks" and can be mistaken for protein-free, carbohydrate-based clear liquids. We used gastric ultrasonography to compare gastric emptying of a protein-free, carbohydrate-based clear liquid with that of a WPND in healthy volunteers. METHODS: We recruited 19 adult (age >/=18 years) volunteers with a body mass index less than 40 kg/m2 and without a history of diabetes mellitus, dysphagia, prior gastric surgery, or allergy to the ingredients of apple juice (AJ) or a WPND. After fasting for eight hours, the volunteers randomly received 474 mL of AJ or a WPND. Gastric ultrasonographic measurements were obtained at baseline and at 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after ingestion of the liquid. RESULTS: We enrolled 19 volunteers. At 120 minutes after consumption, volunteers who ingested a WPND had a larger estimated gastric volume (GV) than volunteers who ingested AJ (median {$[$}interquartile range{$]$}, 101.3 {$[$}70.0-137.4{$]$} vs. 50.6 {$[$}43.9-81.8{$]$} mL; P=.08). By using the 2-sample t test and an alpha level of .05, we determined that the study had 40{\%} power to detect a significant difference in GV. Future studies need to include 24 participants per group to detect a significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: Although consumption of a WPND was associated with a larger estimated GV in this pilot study, a larger study is necessary to conclude whether patients must fast longer than two hours after consumption of a WPND.},

	abstract = {Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) with sole carbohydrate (CHO) loading and postoperative early oral feeding (POEOF) shortened the length of postoperative (PO) hospital stays (LPOHS) without increasing complications. This study aimed to examine the impact of ERAS with preoperative whey protein-infused CHO loading and POEOF among surgical gynecologic cancer (GC) patients. There were 62 subjects in the intervention group (CHO-P), which received preoperative whey protein-infused CHO loading and POEOF; and 56 subjects formed the control group (CO), which was given usual care. The mean age was 49.5 +/- 12.2 years (CHO-P) and 51.2 +/- 11.9 years (CO). The trial found significant positive results which included shorter LPOHS (78.13 +/- 33.05 vs. 99.49 +/- 22.54 h); a lower readmission rate within one month PO (6{\%} vs. 16{\%}); lower weight loss (-0.3 +/- 2.3 kg vs. -2.1 +/- 2.3 kg); a lower C-reactive protein-albumin ratio (0.3 +/- 1.2 vs. 1.1 +/- 2.6); preserved muscle mass (0.4 +/- 1.7 kg vs. -0.7 +/- 2.6 kg); and better handgrip strength (0.6 +/- 4.3 kg vs. -1.9 +/- 4.7 kg) among CHO-P as compared with CO. However, there was no significant difference in mid-upper arm circumference and serum albumin level upon discharge. ERAS with preoperative whey protein-infused CHO loading and POEOF assured better PO outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: to investigate the effects of preoperative fasting abbreviation, a recommendation of Postoperative Accelerated Total Recovery protocol (ACERTO protocol), on postoperative symptoms of patients undergoing gynecological surgeries. METHODS: a double-blind randomized controlled study of 80 gynecological surgeries performed from January to June 2016. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups: Controle Group, with 42 patients, and Juice Group, with 38 patients, who received 200ml inert solution or 200ml carbohydrate- and protein-enriched liquid, respectively, four hours before surgery. The postoperative symptoms studied were thirst, hunger, pain, agitation, satisfaction, and well-being in both groups. To measure the intensity of symptoms, we used the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), associated with the Facial Scale (FS) for pain, applied ten hours after surgery. RESULTS: patients in the Juice Group had less pain (3.51x1.59), thirst (3.63x0.85), hunger (3.86x2.09), and agitation (2.54x0,82) in relation to the Controle Group (P<0.05). Satisfaction (6.89x8.68) and well-being (5.51x7.12) variables were higher (P<0.05) when the carbohydrate- and protein-containing liquid (Juice Group) was ingested in relation to the inert solution (Controle Group). CONCLUSION: the abbreviation of preoperative fasting with carbohydrate- and protein-containing liquid before gynecological surgeries reduces thirst, hunger, pain, agitation, and favors greater satisfaction and well-being than inert solution ingestion.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Oral carbohydrate consumption before surgery improves insulin sensitivity, cardiac output and well-being, and shortens hospital stays without adverse effects. No work has compared higher-dose carbohydrate beverages made for preoperative consumption to common, commercial oral rehydration solutions with lower carbohydrate concentrations. METHODS: We recruited low-risk women undergoing scheduled cesarean deliveries with planned spinal anesthesia. Participants were randomized to one of three groups: those who consumed Clearfast((R)) beverage, those who consumed Gatorade Thirst Quencher((R)) beverage, or fasting control. Participants in the two beverage groups received 710 mL of the appropriate beverage the night before surgery and 355 mL 2 h before surgery. Participants in the control group fasted after midnight the night before surgery. Two hours before surgery, we recorded baseline patient well-being using visual analogue scales, followed by beverage consumption for subjects in the beverage groups. One hour later, we repeated the same assessment. Additional recorded measures included cord blood glucose level, intraoperative variables, breastfeeding success, and a quality of recovery assessment administered 1 day after surgery. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were recruited: 15 received Clearfast((R)), 17 received Gatorade Thirst Quencher((R)), and 15 patients fasted after midnight. Group differences in change in patient well-being using visual analog scales were analyzed using linear regression. Both beverage-consuming groups showed significant improvements in patient well-being using visual analog scales while fasted patients showed no change. CONCLUSION: Either a common oral rehydration beverage or a higher-dose carbohydrate beverage consumed preoperatively resulted in superior well-being compared to fasting. No differences in other outcomes were noted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with clinical trial registration number: NCT02684513.},

@article{Panebianco2020,
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: For several years the scientific anaesthesia societies declared a preoperative fast of 6 hours for solid foods and 2 hours for clear liquids before elective surgical interventions to be sufficient. The aim of this study is to identify the extent of the gap that exists between the preoperative fasting time required and that actually encountered in operating rooms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The safety and clinical applicability of a reduction of the preoperative fasting time was investigated through the use of oral solutions enriched with maltodextrin and their effects on the pre- and postoperative well-being that this may have on patients who are candidates for elective abdominal surgery. The study was conducted in two successive phases (I and II) and patients divided into two groups (A and B). DISCUSSION: Clinical practice is slow to change, in fact, in our study the duration of fasting was an average of 19 hours for solids and 13 hours for liquids. The duration of the fasting did not show differences in the various surgical departments, demonstrating that it is a transversal practice and is not only limited to abdominal surgery in which the utility of fasting would theoretically be greater. Among Group patients A, the fasting time for liquids was about 9 hours. This shows that the time is certainly shorter but not much different when compared to the fasting time for liquids in group B which was on average 14 hours. It is important how difficult it is to achieve good compliance from patients when trying to reduce the time of preoperative fasting based on scientific evidence that is now well established. CONCLUSION: The use of carbohydrate-enriched drinks up to 2 hours after induction of anaesthesia appears to be a safe procedure. The use of these solutions reduces the catabolic response to surgery and contributes to maintaining a pre-operative state of well-being by reducing feelings of hunger and thirst and the state of preoperative anxiety.},

Chart review was performed for 47 patients who received standard preoperative instructions in the preintervention group as historical control. FINDINGS: Patients who received carbohydrate loading had a decreased use of opioids in the first 4 hours after surgery (P = .028) and decreased use of antiemetic medication in the first 24 hours after surgery compared with the preintervention group (P = .066). Patients who were instructed to consume carbohydrate loading complied 87{\%} of the time.

	abstract = {OBJECT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative oral carbohydrate loading versus fasting on the outcomes of patients undergoing elective craniotomy. METHODS: In a single-center randomized controlled study, 120 neurosurgical patients who were admitted for elective craniotomy were included and randomized into 2 groups: 58 patients received 400 mL of oral carbohydrate loading 2 h before surgery (intervention group), and 62 patients were fasting for 8 h prior to surgery as routine management (control group). The primary end point was glucose homeostasis. Secondary outcomes included handgrip strength, pulmonary function and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Better glucose homeostasis (5.6 +/- 1.0 mmol/L vs. 6.3 +/- 1.2 mmol/L, P = 0.001) was achieved in patients who received preoperative oral carbohydrate loading compared to fasting. Furthermore, patients in the intervention group had better handgrip strength (25.3 +/- 7.1 kg vs. 19.9 +/- 7.5 kg, P < 0.0001) and pulmonary function (in terms of peak expiratory flow rate) (315.8 +/- 91.5 L/min vs. 270.0 +/- 102.7 L/min, P = 0.036) compared to the controls postoperatively. The rates of postoperative surgical and non-surgical complications did not differ between the groups. Both postoperative and total hospital length of stay (LOS) reduced significantly in the intervention group (-3d, P < 0.0001 and P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Oral carbohydrate loading given 2 h before surgery in patients undergoing elective craniotomy seems to improve glucose homeostasis, handgrip strength and pulmonary function as well as decrease LOS without increasing the risk of postoperative complications. Routine use of preoperative oral carbohydrate loading could be suggested in clinical settings, though further evaluation of its safety and efficacy is warranted.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of preoperative carbohydrate oral (CHO) loading on the postoperative metabolic and inflammatory response, perioperative discomfort and surgical clinical outcomes in open colorectal surgery compared with a conventional fasting protocol. METHODS: Fifty patients were randomly allocated to either the intervention group (CHO), to receive preoperative oral carbohydrate supplementation, or the control group (FAST), to undergo preoperative fasting. Insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity, the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and IL-6 levels were analysed at 06 h on the day of surgery (T1), 6 h after surgery (T2) and at 06 h on postoperative day 1 (T3) and postoperative day 2 (T4). Thirst, hunger, dry mouth, weakness, anxiety and pain were assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) prior to anaesthesia induction and at 0-4, 4-8, 8-12 and 12-24 h after surgery. Surgical clinical outcomes included the return of gastrointestinal function, time to independent ambulation and postoperative discharge day. RESULTS: Postoperative insulin resistance was 30{\%} lower (p < 0.03) and insulin sensitivity was 15{\%} higher (p < 0.05) in the CHO group than in the FAST group. The GPS was lower in the CHO group at T1 (p < 0.001), T3 (p < 0.01) and T4 (p < 0.004). IL-6 serum levels were lower at the analysed postoperative time points in the CHO group (p < 0.001). The VAS well-being score was lower in the intervention group (p < 0.001); however, the VAS pain score was not significantly different between the groups. The evaluated surgical outcomes appeared earlier in the CHO group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A preoperative CHO drink reduced the postoperative metabolic and inflammatory response and improved subjective well-being and surgical clinical outcomes but did not diminish the VAS pain score.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-operative carbohydrate loading has been shown to reduce pre-operative discomfort and postoperative nausea and vomiting in general surgical patients. Few studies have considered day-case surgery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective randomised study was to determine whether pre-operative carbohydrate loading enhanced recovery after day-case cholecystectomy. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Secondary care in a district general and a university hospital in Finland between 2013 and 2016. PATIENTS: A total of 113 patients American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II aged 18 to 70 undergoing day-case cholecystectomy were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were bleeding or coagulation disorders, BMI more than 40 kg m, dementia, insulin-treated diabetes, migraine, Meniere's disease or a history of alcohol or drug abuse. INTERVENTION: The carbohydrate-rich drink group received oral carbohydrate (200 ml) 2 to 3 h before surgery, and the control (fasting) group fasted from midnight according to standard protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to score six forms of discomfort: the need for analgesia and antiemetics, the time to drinking, eating and first mobilisation after surgery and the time to discharge. Any hospital re-admission was also recorded. RESULTS: The highest VAS scores were seen for mouth dryness and tiredness 2 h after surgery in the fasting group. There were no significant differences in any VAS scores between the study groups. No differences in time to mobilisation, need for pain or antiemetic medication or time to discharge were seen between the groups. CONCLUSION: Compared with overnight fasting, pre-operative carbohydrate loading did not significantly enhance peri-operative well being or recovery in patients undergoing day-case cholecystectomy.

	abstract = {Labouring women have been shown to have slower gastric emptying than non-pregnant subjects, and this argument is sometimes used to recommend fasting guidelines such as nil-by-mouth during labour. We performed a parallel group, randomised non-inferiority trial, comparing gastric emptying of 450 ml isocalorically-adjusted maltodextrin, coffee with milk or pulp-free orange juice, with 18 women in each group. The women were initially fasted for 2 h for clear fluids, 6 h for a light meal and 8 h for a high fat or high protein meal. We performed gastric ultrasound in the semirecumbent-right lateral decubitus position. Gastric antral area was measured at baseline and at 5 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min. Gastric emptying of maltodextrin was significantly faster than coffee with milk (p < 0.001) and orange juice (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between pulp-free orange juice and coffee with milk (p = 0.97). The estimated gastric residual volume was lower than baseline from 90 min after drinking maltodextrin. In labouring women, maltodextrin is cleared from the stomach faster than coffee with milk and orange juice. Gastric emptying depends on other factors besides the caloric load and volume of the drink.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative oral carbohydrate solution (OCS) administration on postoperative insulin resistance and patient comfort in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical study. METHODS: The experimental group received OCS. The control group did not eat or drink before surgery. Glucose and insulin level were measured at baseline, 2 hours before surgery, and at the first and third hour after surgery. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The visual analogue scale (VAS) and general comfort scale (GCS) were used to assess postoperative comfort level. FINDINGS: A significant increase in the glucose level was observed in both groups (P < 0.05). A change in glucose level was significantly higher in the control group (P = .014). HOMA-IR values did not change significantly in the OCS group (P = .160). In the OCS group VAS scores were significantly lower (P < .0001). The OCS group had significantly higher relief (P = .014), ease (P = .001), and transcendence (P < .0001) scores. CONCLUSIONS: OCS decreases insulin resistance and increases comfort.},

@article{Wang2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative oral carbohydrate (POC) has been recommended as an important element of the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol, but its effect on patients undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) remains unclear. Our study aims to investigate the effects of POC for ESD surgery, with particular focus on perioperative well-being and gastric peristalsis. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, and controlled study of patients undergoing ESD was conducted. Seventy-three patients were assigned to 2 groups: experiment (36 patients) and control (37 patients). The experiment group received oral carbohydrate solution 710 mL the night before and 355 mL 2 hours prior to operation. The control group fasted for 10 hours prior to operation. Gastric empty assessment, peristaltic score, and operation score were measured. In addition, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for 6 parameters (thirst, hunger, mouth dryness, nausea, vomit, and weakness) of wellbeing were compared perioperatively. Preoperative basic conditions of patients, postoperative complications, and their clinical outcomes were also recorded. RESULTS: Before anesthesia induction, gastric sonography score was higher in experiment group, while sucked fluid by gastroscopy was similar between 2 groups. And no patient had regurgitation. Moreover, gastric peristaltic score and operation score before operation were both lower in experiment group. Importantly, VAS scores for 3 parameters (thirst, hunger, and mouth dryness) were significantly lower in experiment patients. In addition, clinical outcomes including first time exhaust, first time for drinking water, the usage of hemostasis, postoperative complication, lengths of hospital stay, and in-hospital expense were not significantly different between 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of carbohydrates preoperatively instead of fasting improves the feelings of thirst, hunger, and mouth dryness in patients following ESD surgery without enhancing risk of regurgitation. And, avoiding preoperative fasting with POC can decrease the degree of gastric peristalsis that may facilitate the successful completion of ESD surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess postoperative clinical data considering the association of preoperative fasting with carbohydrate (CHO) loading and intraoperative infusion of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFA). METHODS: 57 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were randomly assigned to receive 12.5{\%} maltodextrin (200 mL, 2 h before anesthesia), (CHO, n=14); water (200 mL, 2 h before anesthesia), (control, n=14); 12.5{\%} maltodextrin (200 mL, 2 h before anesthesia) plus intraoperative infusion of omega-3 PUFA (0.2 g/kg), (CHO+W3, n=15); or water (200 mL, 2 h before anesthesia) plus intraoperative infusion of omega-3 PUFA (0.2 g/kg), (W3, n=14). The need for vasoactive drugs was analyzed, in addition to postoperative inflammation and metabolic control. RESULTS: There were two deaths (3.5{\%}). Patients in CHO groups presented a lower incidence of hospital infection (RR=0.29, 95{\%} CI 0.09-0.94; P=0.023), needed fewer vasoactive drugs during surgery and ICU stay (P<0.05); and had better blood glucose levels in the first six hours of recovery (P=0.015), requiring less exogenous insulin (P=0.018). Incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) varied significantly among groups (P=0.009). Subjects who receive omega-3 PUFA groups had fewer occurrences of POAF (RR=4.83, 95{\%} CI 1.56-15.02; P=0.001). Patients in the W3 group had lower ultrasensitive-CRP levels at 36 h postoperatively (P=0.008). Interleukin-10 levels varied among groups (P=0.013), with the highest levels observed in the postoperative of patients who received intraoperative infusion of omega-3 PUFA (P=0.049). CONCLUSION: Fasting abbreviation with carbohydrate loading and intraoperative infusion of omega-3 PUFA is safe and supports faster postoperative recovery in patients undergoing on-pump CABG.},

@article{Tewari2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The aims of this study were to identify whether differences in distribution of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in obese and non-obese individuals contribute to the magnitude of the postoperative inflammatory response and insulin resistance, with and without preoperative treatment with carbohydrate drinks. METHODS: Thirty-two adults (16 obese/16 non-obese) undergoing elective major open abdominal surgery participated in this 2 x 2 factorial, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants received Nutricia preOp((R)) or placebo (800 ml on the night before surgery/400 ml 2-3 h preoperatively) after stratifying for obesity. Insulin sensitivity was measured using the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp preoperatively and on the 1st postoperative day. Vastus lateralis, omental and subcutaneous fat biopsies were taken pre- and postoperatively and analysed after RNA extraction. The primary endpoint was within subject differences in insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: Major abdominal surgery was associated with a 42{\%} reduction in insulin sensitivity from mean(SD) M value of 37.3(11.8) mumol kg(-1) fat free mass (FFM) to 21.7(7.4) mumol kg(-1) FFM, but this was not influenced by obesity or preoperative carbohydrate treatment. Activation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM1) pathway was seen in response to surgery in omental fat samples. In postoperative muscle samples, gene expression differences indicated activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-alpha)/retinoid X-receptor (RXR-alpha) pathway in obese but not in non-obese participants. There were no significant changes in gene expression pathways associated with carbohydrate treatment. CONCLUSION: The reduction in insulin sensitivity associated with major abdominal surgery was confirmed but there were no differences associated with preoperative carbohydrates or obesity.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Preoperative carbohydrate loading (CHO) could improve insulin sensitivity and promoted postoperative recovery under general anesthesia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CHO on gynecological patients. METHODS: A group of 58 female patients undergoing surgery were randomized to either fast overnight (the FAST group) or receive 800 ml of CHO the evening before and 400 ml 2 h before anesthesia (the CHO group).The perioperative well-being and the nutritional status, as determined by blood samples for three biochemical assays (the base status, the status after the operation, and the status on the first day after the operation), were recorded. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) was used to measure perioperative insulin resistance. The primary endpoint was phantom limb syndrome (PLS) induced by combined spinal and epidural anesthesia (CSEA). RESULTS: The CHO group had significantly lower levels of anxiety (p < 0.01), hunger (p < 0.01), and thirst (p < 0.01); lower incidence of PLS (p < 0.01) and abdominal distention (p < 0.05); earlier occurrence of first flatus (p < 0.01); and fewer hospitalization days (p < 0.01) than patients from the FAST group. Biochemical analysis showed that the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p < 0.01), C-reactive protein (p < 0.01), cortisol (p < 0.01), glucose (p < 0.01), insulin (p < 0.01), and HOMA-IR (p < 0.01) were lower in the CHO patients. Lactate, pyruvate, and lactate/pyruvate ratios for the CHO patients were also lower than those for the FAST patients. CONCLUSIONS: CHO increased perioperative comfort in gynecological patients undergoing CSEA. It also attenuated insulin resistance after the operation and reduced the number of postoperative stress reactions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Routine overnight fasting may increase the risk of postoperative complications and delay postoperative recovery. Oral carbohydrate drinks have been shown to reduce glucose utilization and postoperative negative nitrogen balance while preserving muscle mass and strength. This randomized controlled trial aimed to examine whether preoperative oral carbohydrate drinks can enhance postoperative physical recovery in patients undergoing major colorectal surgery. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Seventy patients were randomly assigned to receive either a 12.5{\%} oral carbohydrate drink or pure water. Patients in both groups received 800- mL of one of the drinks on the evening before surgery, and another 400-mL drink on the morning of the operative day. The primary outcomes were the distances covered in 2-minute-walk tests at 24, 48 and 72-hours and 6- minute walk tests at 7-10 days postoperatively. The secondary outcomes were the postoperative serum insulin and glucose concentrations, nitrogen balance, duration of hospital stay, and the patient satisfaction scores. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the characteristics of the two patients-groups. The postoperative 2-minute and 6-minute walk test distances, serum insulin and glucose concentrations of both groups were not statistically different. Patients receiving carbohydrate drink had more positive nitrogen balance than the control group. The duration of hospital stay and patient satisfaction scores were similar for both-groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistically significant differences in the postoperative walking capacities of patients receiving a carbohydrate drink or pure water; only the nitrogen balance on postoperative day 3 was higher for patients receiving the carbohydrate drink.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the positive effects of preoperative oral carbohydrate administration on clinical outcomes following major surgery have been reported continuously, there are few investigations of them in minor surgical patients. The present study was designed to examine the effects of preoperative oral carbohydrate administration on patient well-being and satisfaction in patients undergoing thyroidectomy. METHODS: Fifty adults aged 20-65 years and scheduled for elective thyroidectomy in first schedule in the morning were allocated to one of two groups. The Control group (n = 25) was requested to obey traditional preoperative fasting after midnight prior to the day of surgery. The Carbohydrate group (n = 25) also fasted overnight but drank 400 ml of carbohydrate-rich drink 2 hours before induction of anesthesia. Patient well-being (thirst, hunger, mouth dryness, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, anxiety and sleep quality) and satisfaction were assessed just before the operating room admission (preoperative) and 6 hours following surgery (postoperative). Other secondary outcomes including oral Schirmer's test and plasma glucose concentrations were also evaluated. RESULTS: The two groups were homogenous in patient characteristics. Seven parameters representing patient well-being evaluated on NRS (0-10) and patient satisfaction scored on a 5-point scale were not statistically different between the two groups preoperatively and postoperatively. There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative oral carbohydrate administration does not appear to improve patient well-being and satisfaction compared with midnight fasting in patients undergoing thyroidectomy in first schedule in the morning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: While carbohydrate loading is an important component of enhanced patient recovery after surgery, no study has evaluated the effects of preoperative carbohydrate loading after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) on patient satisfaction and overall recovery. Thus, we aimed to investigate the impact of preoperative oral carbohydrates on scores from the quality of recovery 40-item (QoR-40) questionnaire after LC. METHODS: A total of 153 adults who underwent LC were randomized into three groups. Group MN-NPO was fasted from midnight until surgery. Group No-NPO received 400 mL of a carbohydrate beverage on the evening before surgery, and a morning dose of 400 mL was ingested at least 2 h before surgery. Group Placebo received the same quantity of flavored water as for group No-NPO. The quality of recovery after general anesthesia was evaluated using QoR-40 questionnaire. Intraoperative hemodynamics were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the groups in terms of the pre- and postoperative global QoR-40 scores (P = 0.257). Group MN-NPO had an elevated heart rate compared to patients who ingested a preoperative beverage (groups No-NPO and Placebo; P = 0.0412). CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative carbohydrate beverage did not improve quality of recovery using the QoR-40 questionnaire after general anesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared to placebo or conventional fasting. However, the preoperative fasting group had a consistently increased heart rate during changes in body position that induced hypotension, which is likely a result of depletion of effective intravascular volume caused by traditional fasting over 8 h.

@article{Tudor-Drobjewski2018,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative fasting is a major cause of perioperative discomfort in paediatric anaesthesia and leads to postoperative insulin resistance, thus potentially enhancing the inflammatory response to surgery. Addressing these problems by preoperative carbohydrate intake has not been a well-defined approach in children. METHODS: We randomised 120 children scheduled for gastroscopy under general anaesthesia to either a control group of standard preoperative fasting or a study group receiving a carbohydrate beverage (PreOp; Nutricia, Erlangen, Germany). Their stomach contents were aspirated endoscopically, and the volume and pH measured. Perioperative discomfort was evaluated using, among other parameters, an observational pain scale in </=4-yr-olds and a VAS in >4-yr-olds. The investigators doing the endoscopies and outcome evaluations were blinded to the study group allocation. RESULTS: Compared with fasting, carbohydrate loading was associated with significantly less gastric content (P=0.01), fewer patients experiencing postoperative nausea (P=0.028), with no significant difference in postoperative vomiting. High preoperative VAS scores (>5) were recorded for only one child in the carbohydrate group vs five children in the fasting group. Bowel cleansing for simultaneous colonoscopies (n=61) made no difference to any of the intergroup findings. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative carbohydrates can reduce nausea and gastric content, the latter being a surrogate parameter for the risk and severity of gastric aspiration into the lungs during anaesthesia. Our study adds knowledge for preoperative fasting guidelines in paediatric anaesthesia. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS00005020.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance after surgery hampers recovery. Oxidative stress is shown to be involved in the occurrence of postoperative insulin resistance. Preoperative carbohydrate-rich oral nutrition supplements reduce but do not prevent insulin resistance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a carbohydrate-, glutamine-, and antioxidant-enriched preoperative oral nutrition supplement on postoperative insulin resistance. METHODS: A double-blind randomized controlled pilot study in 18 patients with rectal cancer, who received either the supplement (S) or the placebo (P) 15, 11, and 4 hours preoperatively, was conducted. Insulin sensitivity was studied prior to surgery and on the first postoperative day using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic 2-step clamp. RESULTS: Hepatic insulin sensitivity (insulin-mediated suppression of glucose production) decreased significantly after surgery in both groups, with no differences between the groups. Peripheral insulin sensitivity (glucose rate of disappearance, Rd) was significantly decreased after surgery in both groups (S: 37.2 {$[$}19.1-50.9{$]$} vs 20.6 {$[$}13.9-27.9{$]$}; P: 23.8 {$[$}15.7-35.5{$]$} vs 15.3 {$[$}12.6-19.1{$]$} micromol/kg.min) but less pronounced in the supplemented group (P = .04). The percentage decrease in glucose Rd did not differ between the groups. Adipose tissue insulin sensitivity (insulin-mediated suppression of plasma free fatty acids) decreased to the same extent after surgery in both groups. CONCLUSION: Rectal cancer surgery induced profound insulin resistance, affecting glucose and fatty acid metabolism. The preoperative nutrition supplement somewhat attenuated but did not prevent postoperative peripheral insulin resistance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore whether preoperative oral carbohydrate (CHO) loading could achieve a reduction in the occurrence of postoperative infections. BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia may increase the risk of infection. Preoperative CHO loading can achieve postoperative glycemic control. METHODS: This was a randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label trial. Nondiabetic adult patients who were candidates for elective major abdominal operation were randomized (1:1) to a CHO (preoperative oral intake of 800 mL of water containing 100 g of CHO) or placebo group (intake of 800 mL of water). The blood glucose level was measured every 4 hours for 4 days. Insulin was administered when the blood glucose level was >180 mg/dL. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of postoperative infection. The secondary endpoint was the number of patients needing insulin. RESULTS: From January 2011 through December 2015, 880 patients were randomly allocated to the CHO (n = 438) or placebo (n = 442) group. From each group, 331 patients were available for the analysis. Postoperative infection occurred in 16.3{\%} (54/331) of CHO group patients and 16.0{\%} (53/331) of placebo group patients (relative risk 1.019, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.720-1.442, P = 1.00). Insulin was needed in 8 (2.4{\%}) CHO group patients and 53 (16.0{\%}) placebo group patients (relative risk 0.15, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.07-0.31, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Oral preoperative CHO load is effective for avoiding a blood glucose level >180 mg/dL, but without affecting the risk of postoperative infectious complication.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pre-operative oral carbohydrate administration (POCA) is an important aspect of enhanced recovery after surgery and has many advantages. The objective of this study was to explore the safety and effect of pre-operative oral carbohydrate administration in infants. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, multi-center, randomized study that randomly assigned 1200 infants into four groups. In the control group (group A), the infants were strictly restricted to 6-h preoperative fasting before anesthesia. In the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) groups (groups B, C, and D), the infants were orally administered a 10{\%} carbohydrate solution (10{\%} glucose water; 5, 10, and 15 mL/kg, respectively) 2 h before anesthesia. Blood glucose, gastric residual volumes, crying ratios, and the length of hospital stay were observed. RESULTS: The blood glucose was significantly higher in groups B, C, and D than group A at the time of anesthesia. The gastric residual volume revealed virtually no residue in groups A, B, and C, but 15 infants in group D had a gastric residual volume. The crying ratio was significantly higher in group A. The length of hospital stay was not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: POCA is well-tolerated in infants at a dose of 10 mL/kg.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative oral carbohydrate therapy has been suggested to attenuate postoperative insulin resistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a carbohydrate-rich beverage given preoperatively on intraoperative glucose metabolism. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This study was a randomised, open-label, placebo-controlled trial. Patients undergoing oral-maxillofacial surgery were divided into two groups. In the glucose group, patients took glucose (50 g/278 mL, p.o.) 2 h before anaesthesia induction after overnight fasting; control-group patients took mineral water. Primary outcome was blood concentrations of ketone bodies (KBs); secondary outcomes were blood concentrations of free fatty acids, insulin and glucose. Concentrations were measured 2 h before anaesthesia (T0), induction of anaesthesia (T1), and 1 h (T2), 3 h (T3), and 5h after anaesthesia start (T4). RESULTS: In the control group (n=11), KBs increased continuously from anaesthesia induction. In the glucose group (n=12), KBs were maintained at low concentrations for 3h after beverage consumption but increased remarkably at T3. At T1 and T2, concentrations of KBs in the glucose group were significantly lower than those in the control group (T1, p=0.010; T2, p=0.028). In the glucose group, glucose concentrations decreased significantly at T2 temporarily, but in the control group, glucose concentrations were stable during this study (T2, p<0.001: glucose vs control). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative intake of glucose (50 g, p.o.) can alleviate ketogenesis for 3 h after consumption but can cause temporary hypoglycaemia after anaesthesia induction.},

	abstract = {Background/aim: The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether the preoperative oral intake of carbohydrate-rich drinks by patients undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft attenuates postoperative insulin requirements, improves postoperative patient discomfort, provides inotropic support, shortens the length of the ICU stay, and shortens the duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation. Materials and methods: This randomized prospective clinical study included 152 patients with coronary artery disease who were divided into 4 groups. Carbohydrates were administered to 3 groups at different hours and doses before operation. The fourth group had an 8-h preoperative fasting period. The inotropic and vasopressor requirements, ventilation time, and ICU stay time were recorded for all of the groups. Patient wellbeing, mouth dryness, hunger, anxiety, and nausea were assessed using VAS scores of 1-10. Results: Mouth dryness and hunger were significantly higher in the control group (P = 0.03, P = 0.02). The increase in blood glucose level was significantly higher in the control group (P = 0.04). The exogenous insulin requirement was significantly higher in the control group than in the other groups (P = 0.04). Conclusion: The administration of carbohydrates before elective cardiac surgery reduced insulin resistance. Based on the VAS scores, the intake of carbohydrates reduced mouth dryness and hunger. Overall, preoperative oral carbohydrate treatments can improve the postoperative outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft surgeries.},

@article{Cakar2017,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The study was conducted to investigate the effect of preoperative oral carbohydrate loading on the preoperative discomforts and postoperative complications of patients undergoing elective thyroidectomy. DESIGN: A randomized controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Ninety patients scheduled for thyroidectomy were divided into three groups: (1) those receiving a carbohydrate-rich drink (CHD), (2) those receiving an overnight 5{\%} glucose intravenous infusion, and (3) those fasting from midnight. The preoperative discomforts and postoperative complications of patients were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The patients' vital signs and blood glucose levels were measured perioperatively. FINDINGS: In the preoperative assessment, hunger, thirst, mouth dryness, chill, and headache adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, and duration of the operation were all found to be significantly higher in the glucose and fasting groups than the CHD group (P < .01). In the postoperative period, the fasting group experienced more vomiting and pain compared with the CHD group (P < .05). A significant difference was found between the groups in terms of diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate in the preoperative and intraoperative periods (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The CHD treatment before thyroidectomy increases patient comfort by reducing preoperative discomfort (such as hunger, thirst, dry mouth, fatigue and headache) and early postoperative complications (vomiting and pain).},

@article{Du2017,
	abstract = {Background: Pre-operative fasting balances safety against patient discomfort. We compared the gastric emptying profiles of a novel clear, high protein drink against a "traditional" clear and a non-clear fluid. Methods: We conducted a prospective cross-sectional study with 48 healthy volunteers, eight to 14 yr of age, fasted overnight and without risk factors for abnormal gastrointestinal motility. Subjects were randomized in equal ratio to ingest 296 ml of apple juice, 2{\%} milk or Ensure Clear. The gastric antrum was seen by ultrasound in the right lateral decubitus position at baseline, after ingestion, then every 30 min thereafter until return to baseline or six h. Gastric antral cross-sectional area was measured independently by two anaesthetists, and compared between drinks. Results: Gastric emptying differed between apple juice, 2{\%} milk and Ensure Clear by analysis of co-variance (P<0.0001), and was faster in males than females (P<0.01). The terminal phase however was similar using interval-censored time to gastric emptying in a survival model (P=0.17) or by comparing proportions with empty stomach vs not empty at 90 min (P=1.0), 120 min (P=0.32), 150 min (P=0.11), 180 min (P=0.76) or 210 min (P=1.0). Conclusions: Despite early differences, clearance from the stomach of apple juice, 2{\%} milk or Ensure Clear is similar at the terminal phase, which is the period of greatest relevance to preoperative fasting recommendations. The stomach is essentially clear by 3-3.5 h for all three drinks studied. The differentiation between liquids in current guidelines is not supported by this study.

@article{Lee2017,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In fasting cardiac surgery patients, preoperative carbohydrate (CHO) drink intake attenuated insulin resistance and improved cardiac metabolism, although its beneficial effects were not evident after cardiac surgery possibly due to cardiopulmonary bypass-related extreme systemic inflammation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether preoperative CHO intake affected insulin resistance and free-fatty acid (FFA) concentrations in off-pump coronary revascularisation. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Primary care in a university hospital in Korea from January 2015 to July 2016. PATIENTS: Sixty patients who underwent elective multi-vessel off-pump coronary revascularisation were randomised into two groups. Three patients were excluded from analysis and 57 patients completed study. INTERVENTION: The CHO group received oral CHO (400 ml) the prior evening and 2 to 3 h before surgery, and the control group was fasted from food and water according to standard protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Insulin resistance was assessed twice, after anaesthetic induction and after surgery via short insulin tolerance test. FFA, C-reactive protein and creatine kinase-myocardial band concentrations were determined serially for 48 h after surgery. RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity was greater (P = 0.002) and plasma FFA concentrations were lower (P = 0.001) after anaesthetic induction in the CHO group compared with the Control group, although there were no intergroup differences after surgery. The postoperative peak creatine kinase-myocardial band concentration was significantly lower in the CHO group compared with the Control group {$[$}8.8 (5.4 to 18.2) vs. 6.4 (3.5 to 9.7) ng ml, P = 0.031{$]$}. CONCLUSION: A preoperative CHO supplement significantly reduced insulin resistance and FFA concentrations compared with fasting at the beginning of the surgery, but these benefits were lost after off-pump coronary revascularisation. Despite their transient nature, these beneficial effects resulted in less myocardial injury, mandating further studies focused on the impact of preoperative CHO on myocardial ischaemia and cardiac function after coronary revascularisation.

@article{Okabe2017,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: We previously demonstrated that the gastric emptying rate of liquids chiefly depended on the total amount of calories (energy content) in a uniform volume. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of different volumes of liquids with a uniform energy content on gastric emptying. METHODS: Three types of test solutions were prepared with a uniform amount of calories (200 kcal provided by glucose) and step-wise increments in volume (200 ml, 400 ml, and 600 ml). The gastric volume of each solution was determined by ultrasound measurements of the gastric antral cross-sectional area after their ingestion by 8 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The mean gastric volume decreased exponentially to nearly 0 ml 70 min after ingestion in the 200 ml group, 90 min in the 400 ml group, and 100 min in the 600 ml group. Each gastric emptying curve converged with identical slopes on the graph when the points at which the gastric emptying curves of the 200 ml and 400 ml groups reached the zero point on the Y-axis (mean gastric volume) were shifted toward 110 min on the X-axis (time scale). CONCLUSIONS: The volume of liquid ingested with a uniform glucose-based energy content is a critical determinant of liquid gastric emptying. The gastric emptying time may be predicted following the ingestion of an isocaloric liquid with any volume over a predefined range once a gastric emptying curve following the ingestion of a liquid has been plotted on a graph.

	abstract = {Sodium picosulfate, used in combination with magnesium oxide and citric acid for bowel cleansing, can result in dehydration. We investigated whether enhanced carbohydrate fluid intake pre-colonoscopy could mitigate this effect. We enrolled 398 elective colonoscopy patients in a prospective, controlled, single-blinded study. The control group (n=194) fasted routinely (minimum seven hours) whilst the treatment group (n=197) drank 1,200 ml carbohydrate solution leading up to admission (up until two hours pre-colonoscopy). On admission a patient survey was completed, and urine specific gravity obtained. Supine blood pressure and pulse rate were measured, and repeated within three minutes of standing. The carbohydrate group had reduced symptoms and signs of dehydration, including thirst (34{\%} versus 65{\%}, P <0.001), dry mouth (45{\%} versus 59{\%}, P=0.008), dizziness (10{\%} versus 20{\%}, P=0.010), lower mean urine specific gravity (1.007 versus 1.017, P <0.001), lower incidence of orthostatic hypotension (2.6{\%} versus 11{\%}, P <0.001), and lower mean erect pulse rate (78 versus 81 /minute, P=0.047). The postural change in systolic blood pressure was less in the treatment group (mean -0.4 mmHg, median -1 mmHg {$[$}interquartile range, IQR -7 to 7{$]$}) than in the control group (mean -4.1 mmHg, median -1 mmHg {$[$}IQR -12 to 3{$]$}, P=0.028). These findings indicate that hydration with carbohydrate solution in patients taking sodium picosulfate has clinical benefit.},

@article{Shiraishi2017,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although preoperative fluid intake 2 hours before anesthesia is generally considered safe, there are concerns about delayed gastric emptying in obese subjects. In this study, the gastric fluid volume (GFV) change in morbidly obese subjects was investigated after ingesting an oral rehydration solution (ORS) and then compared with that in nonobese subjects. METHODS: GFV change over time after the ingestion of 500 mL of ORS containing 2.5{\%} carbohydrate (OS-1) was measured in 10 morbidly obese subjects (body mass index {$[$}BMI{$]$}, >35) scheduled for bariatric surgery and 10 nonobese (BMI, 19-24) using magnetic resonance imaging. After 9 hours of fasting, magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed at preingestion, 0 min (just after ingestion), and every 30 minutes up to 120 minutes. GFV values were compared between morbidly obese and control groups and also between preingestion and postingestion time points. RESULTS: The morbidly obese group had a significantly higher body weight and BMI than the control group (mean body weight and BMI in morbidly obese, 129.6 kg and 46.3 kg/m, respectively; control, 59.5 kg and 21.6 kg/m, respectively). GFV was significantly higher in the morbidly obese subjects compared with the control group at preingestion (73 +/- 30.8 mL vs 31 +/- 19.9 mL, P = .001) and at 0 minutes after ingestion (561 +/- 30.8 mL vs 486 +/- 42.8 mL; P < .001). GFV declined rapidly in both groups and reached fasting baseline levels by 120 minutes (morbidly obese, 50 +/- 29.5 mL; control, 30 +/- 11.6 mL). A significant correlation was observed between preingestion residual GFV and body weight (r = .66; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Morbidly obese subjects have a higher residual gastric volume after 9 hours of fasting compared with subjects with a normal BMI. However, no differences were observed in gastric emptying after ORS ingestion in the 2 populations, and GFVs reached baseline within 2 hours after ORS ingestion. Further studies are required to confirm whether the preoperative fasting and fluid management that are recommended for nonobese patients could also be applied to morbidly obese patients.},

@article{Hellstrom2017,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guidelines for fasting in elderly patients with acute hip fracture are the same as for other trauma patients, and longer than for elective patients. The reason is assumed stress-induced delayed gastric emptying with possible risk of pulmonary aspiration. Prolonged fasting in elderly patients may have serious negative metabolic consequences. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the preoperative gastric emptying was delayed in elderly women scheduled for surgery due to acute hip fracture. METHODS: In a prospective study gastric emptying of 400 ml 12.6{\%} carbohydrate rich drink was investigated in nine elderly women, age 77-97, with acute hip fracture. The emptying time was assessed by the paracetamol absorption technique, and lag phase and gastric half-emptying time was compared with two gender-matched reference groups: ten elective hip replacement patients, age 45-71 and ten healthy volunteers, age 28-55. RESULTS: The mean gastric half-emptying time in the elderly study group was 53 +/- 5 (39-82) minutes with an expected gastric emptying profile. The reference groups had a mean half-emptying time of 58 +/- 4 (41-106) and 59 +/- 5 (33-72) minutes, indicating normal gastric emptying time in elderly with hip fracture. CONCLUSION: This pilot study in women with an acute hip fracture shows no evidence of delayed gastric emptying after an orally taken carbohydrate-rich beverage during the pre-operative fasting period. This implies no increased risk of pulmonary aspiration in these patients. Therefore, we advocate oral pre-operative management with carbohydrate-rich beverage in order to mitigate fasting-induced additive stress in the elderly with hip fracture.

@article{Dilmen2017,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Surgical trauma produces metabolic and hormonal responses, which are characterized by insulin resistance. Due to extension of the preoperative fasting period, which increases the magnitude of postoperative insulin resistance, preoperative oral carbohydrates (POC) have been developed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled study was performed on 43 ASA I-II patients undergoing elective microsurgical lumbar discectomy. The intervention group received oral carbohydrate solution 800mL the night before and 400mL 2h prior to operation. The other group fasted for 8h prior to operation. Blood samples were obtained the day before the operation, before induction of anesthesia, after skin incision, 1h, 2h, 6h and 24h following skin incision. Blood glucose, plasma insulin, cortisol and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were determined. The primary endpoint was to assess the effect of POC treatment on insulin resistance and surgical stress response following lumbar disc surgery. The secondary endpoint was to assess POC's effects on postoperative nausea and vomiting. RESULTS: The serum insulin levels were higher before induction of anesthesia in the study group and returned to fasted group levels by 2h after skin incision. The plasma IL-6 levels were higher in the intervention group at 6h after the skin incision. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to blood glucose, plasma cortisol levels and the incidence of nausea and vomiting. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that use of POC treatment does not attenuate development of insulin resistance in patients undergoing lumbar disc surgery.},

@article{Gomes2017,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: - Abbreviation of preoperative fasting to 2 hours with maltodextrin (CHO)-enriched beverage is a safe procedure and may enhance postoperative recovery. Addition of glutamine (GLN) to CHO beverages may include potential benefits to the metabolism. However, by adding a nitrogenous source to CHO beverages, gastric emptying may be delayed and increase the risk of bronchoaspiration during anesthesia. OBJECTIVE: - In this study of safety, we aimed at investigating the residual gastric volume (RGV) 2 hours after the intake of either CHO beverage alone or CHO beverage combined with GLN. METHODS: - We performed a randomized, crossover clinical trial. We assessed RGV by means of abdominal ultrasonography (US) in 20 healthy volunteers (10 males and 10 females) after an overnight fast of 8 hours. Then, they were randomized to receive 600 mL (400 mL immediately after US followed by another 200 mL 2 hours afterwards) of either CHO (12.5{\%} maltodextrin) or CHO-GLN (12.5{\%} maltodextrin plus 15 g GLN). Two sequential US evaluations were done at 120 and 180 minutes after ingestion of the second dose. The interval of time between ingestion of the two types of beverages was 2 weeks. RESULTS: - The mean (SD) RGV observed after 8 hours fasting (13.56+/-13.25 mL) did not statistically differ (P>0.05) from the RGV observed after ingesting CHO beverage at both 120 (16.32+/-11.78 mL) and 180 minutes (14.60+/-10.39 mL). The RGV obtained at 120 (15.63+/-18.83 mL) and 180 (13.65+/-10.27 mL) minutes after CHO-GLN beverage also was not significantly different from the fasting condition. CONCLUSION: - The RGV at 120 and 180 minutes after ingestion of CHO beverage combined with GLN is similar to that observed after an overnight fast.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative fasting of patients aims to reduce the residual gastric volume (RGV). The magnitude of this reduction is yet to be ascertained in the Nigerian population. AIM: To compare the RGV and pH of patients fasted for 6-12 h with those allowed oral intake of fluid up to 2 h preoperatively. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This randomized study involved 90 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II patients booked for abdominal myomectomy under general anesthesia. The patients were randomized into three groups. Preoperative fasting from midnight (Group F, n = 30) was fasted from midnight to the operation time. Carbohydrate-rich drink group (Group C, n = 30) received 800 mL of oral carbohydrate solution in the evening before surgery (22:00 h). An additional 400 mL was given 2 h before anesthesia. Placebo drink group (Group P, n = 30) received water in the same protocol as Group C. The Student's t-test was used to analyze RGV and pH postoperative satisfaction and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were compared on a visual analog scale. RESULTS: The RGV and pH were similar for all groups (P = 0.45 and 0.90, respectively). Antiemetic consumption and PONV scores were lower in Group C compared with Groups F and P (P = 0.01). Patients' in Group C had higher satisfaction (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Preoperative carbohydrate or water intake up to 2 h before surgery is safe with better satisfaction when compared to overnight fasting.},

@article{De-Jonghe2016,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The need to preserve operating room (OR) scheduling flexibility can challenge adherence to the 2-h pre-operative fasting period recommendation before elective surgery. Our primary objective was to assess the feasibility of a pre-operative carbohydrate (CHO) drink delivery strategy preserving OR scheduling flexibility. METHODS: During the 1st study phase, patients admitted for elective surgery fasted overnight (Control group); during the 2nd phase, patients fasted overnight and received a pre-operative CHO drink (CHO group). CHO delivery time was set to allow any patient to be ready for surgery 30 min ahead of the scheduled time and any patient with an operation scheduled in the afternoon to be ready at 13:00 hours; patients admitted the morning of an early morning operation would not be allowed to take a CHO drink. RESULTS: We included 194 patients in the Control group and 199 in the CHO group. In the CHO group, the morning CHO dose was delivered to 66.3{\%} of the patients (95{\%} CI 59.3-72.9{\%}), with a median pre-operative fasting time period of 4 h 57 min. After excluding patients admitted the morning of an operation scheduled before 10:00 hours, the delivery rate was 77.2{\%} (70.2-83.3{\%}). Patients in the CHO group experienced significantly less pre-operative thirst (median 2 vs. 5 on a 0-10 scale, P < 0.0001) and hunger (0 vs. 2, P < 0.0001) than those in the Control group. CONCLUSION: Although preservation of OR scheduling flexibility resulted in a longer fasting time than recommended, CHO drink can be made available to a large proportion of patients with significantly reduced perioperative discomfort.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Enhanced recovery after surgery is increasingly desired nowadays, and preoperative nutrient intake may be beneficial for this purpose. In this study, we investigated whether the intake of preoperative carbohydrate with amino acid (ONS) solution can improve starvation status and lipid catabolism before the induction of anesthesia. METHODS: This randomized, prospective clinical trial included 24 patients who were divided into two groups before surgery under general anesthesia: a control group, comprising patients who fasted after their last meal the day before surgery (permitted to drink only water), and an ONS group, comprising patients who consumed ONS solution 2 h before surgery. Biochemical markers, the respiratory quotient, and psychosomatic scores were assessed at the initiation of anesthesia. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the ONS group showed significantly lower serum free fatty acid levels {$[$}control group: 828 (729, 1004) microEq/L, ONS group: 479 (408, 610) microEq/L, P = 0.0002, median (25th, 75th percentile){$]$} and total ketone bodies {$[$}control group: 119 (68, 440) micromol/L, ONS group: 40 {$[$}27, 64{$]$} micromol/L, P = 0.037{$]$}. In addition, analysis using the Visual Analog Scale showed higher preoperative scores for anxiety, hunger, and thirst for the control group, with no differences in any other measure of subjective well-being between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that preoperative ONS intake improves lipid catabolism and starvation status before the induction of anesthesia. Furthermore, it can provide better preoperative mental health compared with complete fasting.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The effects of oral carbohydrate solutions, ingested 2 h prior to operation, on stress response were studied in patients undergoing general or epidural anaesthesia. METHODS: The study was performed on 80 ASA I-II adult patients undergoing elective total hip replacement, which were randomized to four groups (n=20). Group G patients undergoing general anaesthesia fasted for 8 h preoperatively; Group GN patients undergoing general anaesthesia drank oral carbohydrate solutions preoperatively; Group E patients undergoing epidural anaesthesia fasted for 8 h and Group EN patients undergoing epidural anaesthesia drank oral carbohydrate solutions preoperatively. Groups GN and EN drank 800 mL of 12.5{\%} oral carbohydrate solution at 24:00 preoperatively and 400 mL 2 h before the operation. Blood samples were taken for measurements of glucose, insulin, cortisol and IL-6 levels. RESULTS: The effect of preoperative oral carbohydrate ingestion on blood glucose levels was not significant. Insulin levels 24 h prior to surgery were similar; however, insulin levels measured just before surgery were 2-3 times higher in groups GN and EN than in groups G and E. Insulin levels at the 24(th) postoperative hour in epidural groups were increased compared to those at basal levels, although general anaesthesia groups showed a decrease. From these measurements, only the change in Group EN was statistically significant (p<0.05). Plasma cortisol levels at the 2(nd) peroperative hour were higher in epidural groups than in general anaesthesia groups. Both anaesthesia techniques did not have an effect on IL-6 levels. CONCLUSION: We concluded that epidural anaesthesia suppressed stress response, although preoperative oral carbohydrate nutrition did not reveal a significant effect on surgical stress response.},

@article{Song2016,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastric ultrasound is a valid tool for non-invasive assessment of the nature and volume of gastric contents in adults and children. Perioperative fasting guidelines recommend oral carbohydrates up to 2 h before elective surgery. We evaluated gastric volume in children using ultrasound before and after drinking carbohydrate fluids before surgery. METHODS: Paediatric patients younger than 18 yr old undergoing elective surgery were enrolled. Initial ultrasound assessment of gastric volume was performed after fasting for 8 h. Two hours before surgery, patients were given carbohydrate drinks: 15 ml kg(-1) for patients younger than 3 yr old and 10 ml kg(-1) for those more than 3 yr old. Before induction of general anaesthesia, the gastric volume was reassessed. Parental satisfaction scores (0=totally satisfied, 10=totally dissatisfied) and complications were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 86 enrolled patients, 79 completed the study; three refused to ingest the requested volume, and surgery was delayed for more than 2 h in four patients. The mean (sd) of the initial and second ultrasound measurements were 2.09 (0.97) and 1.85 (0.94) cm(2), respectively (P=0.01; mean difference 0.24 cm(2), 95{\%} confidence interval 0.06-0.43). The median (interquartile range) satisfaction score was 2.4 (0-6). Two instances of postoperative vomiting and one instance of postoperative nausea occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Carbohydrate fluids ingested 2 h before surgery reduced the gastric volume and did not cause serious complications in paediatric patients. Parents were satisfied with the preoperative carbohydrate drink. Children may benefit from drinking carbohydrate fluids up to 2 h before elective surgery.

@article{Bang2016,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients receiving a carbohydrate drink (CHO) before major abdominal surgery display improved insulin sensitivity postoperatively and increased proteolysis of IGFBP-3 (IGFBP-3-PA) compared to patients undergoing similar surgery after overnight fasting. AIMS: We hypothesized that serum IGFBP-3-PA increases bioavailability of circulating IGF-I and preserves insulin sensitivity in patients given CHO. DESIGN: Matched control study. METHODS: At Karolinska University Hospital, patients given CHO before major elective abdominal surgery (CHO,n = 8) were compared to patients undergoing similar surgical procedures after overnight fasting (FAST,n = 10). Results from two different techniques for determination of free-dissociable IGF-I (fdIGF-I) were compared with changes in IGFBP-3-PA and insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: Postoperatively, CHO displayed 18{\%} improvement in insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic clamp) and increased IGFBP-3-PA vs. FAST. As determined by IRMA, fdIGF-I increased by 48 +/- 25{\%} in CHO while fdIGF-I decreased by 13 +/- 18{\%} in FAST (p < 0.01 vs. CHO, when corrected for duration of surgery). However, fdIGF-I determined by ultra-filtration decreased similarly in both groups (-22 +/- 8{\%} vs. -25 +/- 8{\%}, p = 0.8) and IGFBP-1 increased similarly in both groups. Patients with less insulin resistance after surgery demonstrated larger increases in fdIGF-I by IRMA (r = 0.58, p < 0.05). Fifty-three {\%} of the variability of the changes in fdIGF-I by IRMA could be explained by changes in IGFBP-3-PA and total IGF-I levels (p < 0.05), while IGFBP-1 did not contribute significantly. CONCLUSION: During conditions when serum IGF-I bioavailability is regulated by IGFBP-3 proteolysis, measurements of fdIGF-I by IRMA is of physiological relevance as it correlates with the associated changes in insulin sensitivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients experience postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Preoperative treatment with carbohydrate solutions seems to improve the course after different types of surgery. This study was undertaken to investigate the potential value of different models for preoperative hydration/nutrition, in addition to our ERAS (enhanced recovery after surgery) protocol. METHODS: Ninety non-diabetic women planned for elective laparoscopic gastric bypass and aged 18-65 years were included. All were on preoperative low-calorie diet (LCD). They were randomized into three arms, either a carbohydrate-rich drink, a protein-enriched drink, or tap water and instructed to drink 800 and 200 mL 16 and 2 h, respectively, prior to operation. Risk factors for PONV were recorded preoperatively. All patients were operated before lunch and received 1500-2000 mL of Ringer-Acetate solution during the 24-30-h postoperative hospital time. Four variables (nausea, pain, tiredness, and headache) were registered on 100-mm visual analog scales six times over 22 h. The need for additional medication was registered. RESULTS: Out of 90 patients, 73 complete datasets were obtained. Nausea peaked at 7 p.m. but with no statistically significant differences between groups for any of the variables. Pain peaked the first 2 h postoperatively, remained longer, and had not returned to baseline values at 6 a.m. the morning after surgery but with no difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Inside our ERAS protocol, additional preoperative carbohydrate- or protein-enriched fluid treatment did not further reduce immediate patient discomfort in laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting is the most common cause for unexpected hospital admission of patients undergoing day care surgery. Overnight fasting changes patient metabolic state and influences their perioperative stress response. Preoperative carbohydrate loading may have accelerated recovery and better overall outcome after major abdominal surgery. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of preoperative carbohydrate-rich drinks on postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain after day care laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: A total of 120 patients posted for day care laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included in the study and were randomized into three groups. Group A (Cases)-receiving the carbohydrate-rich drink before surgery (CHO), group B (placebo)-receiving the placebo drink before surgery and group C (controls)-fasting from midnight before surgery. Postoperative nausea and vomiting and visual analogue score for pain were noted and analyzed for 24 h. RESULTS: Mean score of nausea in 0-4 h in group A was significantly lower as compared to group B and group C (p = 0.001). Difference in mean score of nausea in 4-12 and 12-24 h between groups was not significant (p = 0.066), (p = 0.257). Mean score of vomiting in 0-4 and 4-12 h in group A was significantly less than that of group B and group C (p = 0.004), (p = 0.001). Mean score of pain in group A was significantly less when compared to group B and group C in 0-4 h (p = 0.001) and 4-12 h (0.005). CONCLUSION: Perioperative consumption of a carbohydrate-rich drink can minimize postoperative nausea, vomiting and pain in patients undergoing outpatient cholecystectomy. Consumption of carbohydrate drinks up to 2 h prior to surgery is not associated with additional complications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of preoperative administration of oral carbohydrate (CHO) or oral rehydration solution (ORS). However, the effects of preoperative CHO or ORS on postoperative quality of recovery after anesthesia remain unclear. Consequently, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative CHO or ORS on patient recovery, using the Quality of Recovery 40 questionnaire (QoR-40). METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial included American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1 and 2 adult patients, who were scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure of body surface. Subjects were randomized to one of the three groups: 1) preoperative CHO group, 2) preoperative ORS group, and 3) control group. The primary outcome was the global QoR-40 administered 24 h after surgery. Intraoperative use of vasopressor, intraoperative body temperature changes, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were also evaluated. RESULTS: We studied 134 subjects. The median {$[$}interquartile range (IQR){$]$} global QoR-40 scores 24 h after the surgery were 187 {$[$}177-197{$]$}, 186 {$[$}171-200{$]$}, and 184 {$[$}171-198{$]$} for the CHO, ORS, and control groups, respectively (p = 0.916). No significant differences existed between the groups regarding intraoperative vasopressor use during the surgery (p = 0.475). CONCLUSIONS: Results of the current study indicated that the preoperative administration of either CHO or ORS did not improve the quality of recovery in patients undergoing minimally invasive body surface surgery.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: this study aims to assess the organic inflammatory response of the video laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with abbreviation of the preoperative fasting to 2h using a carbohydrate and protein enriched solution. METHODS: this is a randomized, prospective study with patients divided into the following 2 groups: group A, conventional fasting and group B, 2h abbreviated fasting with oral ingestion of a carbohydrate and protein solution. Serum glucose, insulin, interleukin 1, and TNF-alpha were mesasured before ingestion of the solution, during induction of anesthesia, and 4 h after the end of surgery. RESULTS: thirty-eight patients completed the study without presenting pulmonary complications associated with bronchoaspiration. The postoperative HOMA-IR variance was greater in group A (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: the abbreviation of preoperative fasting for 2 h, using carbohydrate and protein enriched solutions, is safe, reduces insulin resistance, and does not increase the risk of bronchoaspiration.},

@article{Pedziwiatr2015,
	abstract = {UNLABELLED: Postoperative insulin resistance, used as a marker of stress response, is clearly an adverse event. It may induce postoperative hyperglycemia, which according to some authors can increase the risk of postoperative complications. One of the elements of modern perioperative care is preoperative administration of oral carbohydrate loading (CHO-loading), which shortens preoperative fasting and reduces insulin resistance. The aim of the study is to establish the influence of CHO-loading on the level of insulin resistance and cortisol in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to one of 2 groups. The intervention group included 20 patients who received CHO-loading (400 ml Nutricia pre-op(R)) 2 hours prior surgery. The control group received a placebo (clear water). In every patient blood samples were taken 2 hours prior to surgery, immediately after surgery, and on the 1st postoperative day. Levels and changes in glucose, cortisol and insulin resistance were analyzed in both groups. RESULTS: Although there were differences in the levels of cortisol, insulin, and insulin resistance, no statistically significant differences were observed between groups in every measurement. The length of stay and postoperative complications were comparable in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that CHO-loading is not clinically justified in case of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. No effect on the levels of glucose, insulin resistance and cortisol was observed. Even though such procedure is safe, in our opinion there is no clinical benefit from CHO-loading prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this prospective, randomized, single-blinded study was to compare the effects of preoperative fast for clear fluids on insulin resistance and hemodynamic stability on patient undergoing maxillofacial surgery. METHOD: In this study 20 patients undergoing maxillofacial surgery were randomized into four groups i.e. - group I patients with standard 08 h fasting before anesthesia, group-II patients were given 400 ml and 200 ml of water 08 h and 2 h respectively before anesthesia, group III patients were given 400 ml water with 50 gms of glucose and 40 gm of glutamine 08 h before anesthesia and 200 ml water with 25 gms of glucose and 10 gm of glutamine 2 h before anesthesia, group IV patients were given 400 ml water with 50 gms of glucose 08 h before anesthesia and 200 ml water with 25 gms of glucose 2 h before anesthesia. Blood samples were collected pre-operatively and post-operatively. RESULTS: Overall results suggest that Post-operative insulin resistance was greater in control patients (2.0 {$[$}0.3{$]$}) compared with the other 3 groups (placebo = 1.8 {$[$}0.9{$]$}); glutamine = (1.8 {$[$}0.6{$]$}); carbohydrate = (1.9 {$[$}0.6{$]$}). DISCUSSION: This study shows that shortening of pre-operative fasting time for clear fluids until 2- h prior to anesthesia may induce a favorable environment for the post-operative course. In conclusion, Glutamine with carbohydrate drink can be used safely in surgical patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carbohydrate-rich liquid drinks (CRLDs) have been recommended to attenuate insulin resistance by shortening the preoperative fasting interval. The aim of our study the effect of preoperative oral administration of CRLDs on the well-being and clinical status of patients. METHODS: A randomized, double blind, prospective study of patients undergoing open colorectal operations (CR) and open cholecyctectomy (CH) was conducted. Patients were divided into three groups: study, placebo, and control. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for seven parameters (thirst, hunger, anxiety, mouth dryness, nausea, weakness and sleep quality) were recorded and compared for two different time periods (up to 24 h postoperatively and from 36 to 48 h postoperatively). The Simplified Acute Physiology Score changes (SAPS)-II between the three groups were also studied. RESULTS: There were 142 patients American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) I or II enrolled in the study (CR = 71 and CH = 71). There were no significant differences in postoperative SAPS-II scores or lengths of hospital stay (LOS) between the groups. However, in CR patients, the degree of thirst was partially improved by drinking CRLDs (P = 0.027). In CH patients, on the other hand, feelings of thirst, hunger, mouth dryness, nausea and weakness showed significant improvement (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oral administration of carbohydrate-rich liquid drinks (CRLDs) improves the well-being in patients undergoing CH, but the effect is less evident in patients undergoing CR. No significant improvements were seen in clinical status or in length of hospital stay in either group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ANZCTR.org.au: ACTRN12614000995673 (registered on 16/09/2014).},

@article{Canbay2014,
	abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effects of oral carbohydrate solution consumed until 2 h before the surgery in the patients that would undergo open radical retropubic prostatectomy on postoperative metabolic stress, patient anxiety, and comfort. METHOD: A total of 50 adult patients, who were in ASA I-II group and would undergo open radical retropubic prostatectomy, were included in the study. While Group 1 = CH (n = 25) received oral glucose solution, Group 2 = FAM (n = 25) was famished starting from 24:00 h. Blood glucose, insulin, and procalcitonin levels of the patients were recorded, and the patients completed state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) test, which reflects the anxiety level of the patients, both before surgery and on the postoperative 24th hour. In order to evaluate patient comfort, senses of hunger, thirst, nausea, and cold were assessed in the morning prior to the surgery. RESULTS: No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of demographic data and insulin resistance levels (p > 0.05). Comparing with the preoperative levels, insulin resistance showed statistically significant elevation in both groups (p < 0.05). Procalcitonin levels were similarly increased in both groups in the postoperative period (p < 0.05). Preoperative and postoperative STAI state scores were similar in both groups (p > 0.05). With regard to preoperative patient comfort, sense of hunger was present in lesser number of subjects and at lower level in Group 1 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Preoperative consumption of high carbohydrate drink (Pre-op) decreases insulin resistance and enhances patient comfort leading to lesser sense of hunger and thirst in the preoperative period in open radical retropubic prostatectomies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative administration of clear fluids by mouth has recently been endorsed as a way to improve postoperative outcomes. A carbohydrate-containing beverage supplemented with electrolytes or proteins may have additional benefits for patients' satisfaction. However, effects on gastric residual, nausea, and emesis and the effectiveness of these beverages for improving patients' hydration status have not been well defined. METHODS: We evaluated changes in gastric volume over time by magnetic resonance imaging, as well as blood glucose levels, before and after administration of 500 mL oral rehydration solution (ORS) containing 1.8{\%} glucose and electrolytes in 10 healthy volunteers. The same volume of an oral nutritional supplement (ONS) containing 18{\%} glucose and supplemental arginine (545 mOsm/kg) was given to the same population using a crossover design. RESULTS: The mean (median, 95{\%} confidence interval) gastric fluid volume at 1 hour after oral ingestion was 55.0 (55.3, 39.0-70.9) mL in the ORS group, whereas 409.2 (410.9, 371.4-447.0) mL in the ONS group (P = 0.0002). The gastric fluid volume of all participants in the ORS group returned to <1 mL/kg at 90 minutes after ingestion, whereas none reached <1 mL/kg at 120 minutes in the ONS group. The ONS group showed a sustained increase in the blood glucose level after ingestion (P < 0.0001 to baseline at 30, 60, 120 minutes), while the ORS group showed an initial increase (P < 0.0001, P = 0.01, P = 0.205 at each time point). CONCLUSIONS: ORS supplemented with a small amount of glucose showed faster gastric emptying, which may make it suitable for preoperative administration. In contrast, ONS supplemented with arginine with a relatively low osmolality was associated with a longer time for gastric emptying, although it showed a sustained increase in blood glucose level.},

@article{Ljunggren2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Surgery initiates a series of physiological stress processes in the body, inducing transient insulin resistance. Preoperative carbohydrate treatment can reduce the latter phenomenon. We investigated the effects of carbohydrate loading on insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function after elective hip replacement. METHODS: Twenty-three nondiabetic patients (mean age of 68 years) who underwent elective hip replacement surgery participated in this double-blind controlled study. The patients were randomised to a nutrition group, which ingested a carbohydrate-rich fluid (50 kcal/100 ml) (Preop((R))), or a control group (tap water flavoured with lemon) 800 ml + 400 ml before the surgery. The insulin response (beta-cell function) and the insulin sensitivity were measured with an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamp, respectively, one day before and two days after the surgery. RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity decreased by 51{\%} (median; 25-75th percentiles 35-61) after ingesting Preop((R)) and by 39{\%} (21-51) after ingesting in the control group (n.s.). The postoperative IVGTT in the nutrition group was followed by a significantly larger area under the curve (AUC) for plasma insulin (+54{\%} versus the preoperative IVGTT) compared to the control group (+7{\%}). This difference was already apparent during the first phase (0-10 min) of insulin secretion (+20 and -21{\%}, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The patients randomised to the carbohydrate oral fluid or the water prior to the surgery demonstrated a significant but similar decrease in insulin sensitivity. The carbohydrates increased the beta-cell function as a compensatory response to the disposition index, resulting in a smaller reduction in surgery-induced insulin resistance compared to the tap water. The study was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01774084).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative oral carbohydrate (CHO) drink may improve patients' comfort. However, whether it prevents or reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is questionable. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effect of oral rehydration with 10{\%} CHO drink before anesthesia on incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after spinal morphine injection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: One hundred patients scheduled for unilateral total knee replacement (TKR) were randomly divided into two equal groups (n = 50 each). Group I patients received 400 ml 10{\%} CHO drink the preoperative night and 2-hour before anesthesia, whereas Group II patients served as control. Spinal anesthesia for all patients contained 0.5{\%} bupivacaine 2.0 to 3.5 ml plus morphine 0.2 mg. Pain therapy was standardized with femoral nerve block, local infiltration, intravenous parecoxib, and oral paracetamol. Incidence and severity of PONV within 24 hours were recorded In addition, preoperative intensity of thirst and hunger, dry lips and throat, and anxiety was also recorded RESULTS: Incidence and severity of PONV (81.2{\%} vs. 72.0{\%}, p = 0.536) as well as preoperative thirst, hunger dry lips, and throat were not different between the groups. CONCLUSION: Preoperative oral rehydration with carbohydrate drinks had no positive effect on PONV nor patients' comfort.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The need for long preoperative fasting has been questioned. Recent data shows that intake of an oral carbohydrate-containing clear fluid prior to anaesthesia is safe and may have a positive impact on recovery and metabolic status and could improve glucose tolerance. Such solutions are routinely used in adults but not children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerance and influence of oral carbohydrate on selected metabolic parameters in children. METHODS: With ethics committee approval and parental informed consent, 20 children, aged 4-17 years, ASA status I or II, scheduled for abdominal or thoracic surgery were randomised either to Group 1 - receiving a 12.6{\%} carbohydrate-containing drink (10 mL kg(-1) the evening before surgery and two hours before anaesthesia), or the control Group 2 - fasting. Serum glucose and insulin concentration were measured four times: before and after anaesthesia, in the evening after surgery, and the following morning. IGF-1 concentration was measured once, before surgery. Insulin resistance was assessed by the HOMA-IR equation. RESULTS: Oral carbohydrate solution was well tolerated and no adverse events were noted. Glucose concentrations were within the normal range in both groups. Insulin concentration did not show significant differences between groups, however before surgery it tended to be lower in Group 1. Insulin resistance after surgery was significantly higher in Group 2 (2.0 vs. 0.62, P = 0.03), also the increase in insulin resistance after operation was significant only in the control group (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Oral carbohydrates are safe, well tolerated and do not cause any perioperative adverse events. They seem to improve postoperative metabolism by decreasing insulin resistance.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The addition of glutamine in preoperative drinks may enhance the benefits of carbohydrate alone. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the gastric residual volume after the intake of a beverage containing carbohydrate plus glutamine. METHODS: Eleven healthy volunteers (24-30 years-old) were randomized in a crossover fashion to intake 400 mL (4h before) and 200 mL (2h before) of a beverage containing either 12.5{\%} maltodextrin (carbohydrate group) or 12.5{\%} maltodextrin plus 15 g of glutamine (glutamine group) in two different moments 7 days apart. Magnetic ressonance was performed to measure the gastric residual volume (mL) 120 and 180 minutes after the last ingestion. RESULTS: Gastric residual volume similar to basal condition was found after 2h and 3h of the intake of beverages. There was no difference in the mean +/-SD GRV (mL) found at 120 minutes (carbohydrate group: 22.9+/-16.6 and glutamine group: 19.7+/-10.7) and at 180 minutes (carbohydrate group: 21.5+/-24.1 and glutamine group: 15.1+/-10.1) between the two drinks. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric emptying is efficient, and occurs in up to two hours after the intake of a beverage containing either carbohydrate alone or carbohydrate associated with glutamine. The addition of glutamine to carbohydrate-enriched drink seems to be safe for the use up to 2h before an operation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the gastric emptying of an oral supplement containing carbohydrate plus whey protein drunk before sedation for gastroscopy. METHODS: This is a randomized double-blind trial including adult patients (ages 18-65) with a chief complaint of epigastric burning and who were candidates to elective gastroscopy. After overnight fast subjects were randomized to drink 200 mL of an oral nutritional supplement containing maltodextrine in addition to whey protein 150 to 210 min before the gastroscopy (intervention group, n = 12) or to undergo the endoscopic procedure with no supplement (control group, n = 12). The residual gastric volume (RGV) suctioned and measured during the exam was the main endpoint of the study. RESULTS: There were no complications during all exams. The median (range) fasting time was greater (P < 0.001) in control group (770 min, ranging from 660-917 min) than in the study group (175 min ranging from 150 to 210 min). The median (range) RGV was similar in between the two groups (control group: 25 (10-70) mL versus intervention group: 10 (0-100) mL; p = 0.32). CONCLUSION: Gastric emptying 150-210 min after the ingestion of an oral supplement containing carbohydrate plus whey protein is similar to an overnight fasting condition. Although limited by the number of cases, the sedation for endoscopic procedures is safe with this fasting protocol.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adenotonsillectomy is a common otolaryngology surgery. Nausea and vomiting are the most common complications of this procedure with a prevalence ranging from 49{\%} to 73 {\%}. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate the effects of short time fasting protocol on decreasing postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, and initiation of oral feeding after adenotonsillectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 120 children aged 4 to 14 years candidates for adenotonsillectomy were randomly divided into intervention and control groups (n = 120, 60 in each group). Each patient of the intervention group was given oral dextrose 10{\%} as much volume as he could consume at 3 and 6 hours prior to the operation. All the data including pain severity, nausea and vomiting of the patients, the time of oral feeding initiation etc. were gathered in checklists after the operation. Statistical analyses were then performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 16. Descriptive statistical methods and mean difference test for independent groups and chi square test or Fisher exact test, and if regression needed model test were applied. A P value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The amount of Acetaminophen administered for the intervention group was significantly lower than the control group, and also the time of oral feeding initiation was significantly shorter in the intervention group than the control group (P < 0.005). Pain severity at all occasions following surgery was significantly lower in the intervention group than the control group (P < 0.001). Although frequency of nausea at recovery time was significantly lower in the intervention group than the control group (P < 0.002), there were no significant differences in frequency of nausea between the two groups at other postoperative occasions. Postoperative vomiting frequency was not significant between the two groups at any occasions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this survey showed that shortening the duration of pre-adenotonsillectomy fasting period and hydration of patients several hours prior to the operation might be effective in decreasing postoperative pain and facilitating postoperative oral feeding initiation. Nevertheless this method does not seem to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has been performed after fasting 8 or more hours, which can be harmful to the patients. We assessed comfort, safety and quality of endoscopy under moderate sedation after 2 hours fasting for clear liquids. METHODS: In this clinical trial, patients referred for elective endoscopy were randomly assigned to a fasting period of 8 hours (F8) or a shorter fasting (F2), in which 200 ml of clear liquids were ingested 2 hours before the procedure. Endoscopists blinded to patients fasting status carried out the endoscopies. Comfort was rated by the patients, whereas safety and quality were determined by the endoscopists. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were studied (aging 48.5 +/- 16.5 years, 60{\%} women): 50 patients (51{\%}) in F2 and 48 in F8. Comfort was higher in F2 than F8 in regard to anxiety (8{\%} vs. 25{\%}; P = 0.029), general discomfort (18{\%} vs. 42{\%}; P = 0.010), hunger (44{\%} vs. 67{\%}; P = 0.024), and weakness (22{\%} vs. 42{\%}; P = 0.034). Regurgitation of gastric contents into the esophagus after endoscopic intubation did not differ between F2 and F8 (26{\%} vs. 19{\%}; P = 0.471). There was no case of pulmonary aspiration. Gastric mucosal visibility was normal in most patients either in F2 or F8 (96{\%} vs. 98{\%}; P = 0.999). CONCLUSIONS: Elective upper GI endoscopy after 2 hours fasting for clear liquids was more comfortable and equally safe compared to conventional fasting. This preparation might be cautiously applied for patients in regular clinical conditions referred for elective endoscopy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: SAMMPRIS ClinicalTrial.gov number, NCT01492296.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Fasting period before surgery may change metabolic status of the patient and have influence on perioperative stress response. The aim of the study was to investigate effects of preoperative carbohydrate-rich beverage on stress response after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODOLOGY: Patients admitted for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included into study and they were randomized into a group that was fed prior to surgery and in a group that was in the regime of nothing by mouth from the evening one day before surgery. Concentrations of C-reactive protein and cortisol, were measured before and subsequently up to 48 h postoperatively. RESULTS: Postoperative serum C-reactive protein increased significantly in both groups, but the increase was more evident in the group with fasting protocol both 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. In fed patients cortisol concentration measured in the afternoon immediately after the operation showed physiological decline. In patients with fasting protocol postoperative cortisol values rise above the values measured in the morning. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative feeding has advantage over overnight fasting by reducing preoperative discomfort in patients after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective, randomized, single-blinded study was to compare the effects of a carbohydrate drink 400 mL given 2 h before the surgery with preoperative overnight fasting on the gastric pH and residual volume, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and antiemetic consumption in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II patients who underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Randomized, prospective, controlled study, Gulhane Medical Faculty and Guven Hospital Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: Pre-operative carbohydrate drink group (group C, n = 20) and preoperative fasting group (group F, n = 20). Group C was given a 400 mL carbohydrate drink 2 h before to the surgery. The patients of group F were fasted 8 h before the surgery. Both groups were operated under general anesthesia with volatile anesthetics. RESULTS: Hemodynamic parameters, demographic data, gastric acidity and residual volumes were similar for both groups. No complications were observed. PONV and antiemetic consumption was lower in group C compared to group F (P = 0.001). Patient's satisfaction was higher in group C (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that pre-operative carbohydrate drink may be used safely and also improves patient's satisfaction and comfort in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical stress creates a state of insulin resistance which may contribute to the development of hyperglycemia and, subsequently, postoperative complications. Consumption of an oral carbohydrate supplement before surgery may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce hyperglycemia. In this trial, we investigated the effects of carbohydrate supplementation on insulin resistance in coronary artery bypass graft and spinal decompression and fusion surgical patients. METHODS: Twenty-six patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft and 12 undergoing spine surgery were randomized to receive 800 mL of an oral carbohydrate supplement the evening before and 400 mL 2 hours before surgery (CHO) or to fasting per standard hospital protocol (FAST). Baseline and postoperative measurements of insulin sensitivity were assessed using the short insulin tolerance test and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and free fatty acid levels were determined at baseline, postoperatively, and 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. Adiponectin was measured at baseline. Subjective feelings of well-being were measured immediately before surgery, and intra- and postoperative outcomes were documented. RESULTS: Postoperative insulin sensitivity did not differ significantly between the FAST and CHO groups whether measured by the short insulin tolerance test (rate of disappearance of blood glucose: 0.29{\%}/min vs 0.38{\%}/min; 99{\%} confidence interval {$[$}CI{$]$} for difference, -0.17 to 0.32, P = 0.41) or HOMA (insulin resistance at values >1: 2.3 vs 3.3; 99{\%} CI for difference, -0.8 to 2.8, P = 0.14). Circulating blood glucose levels after surgery in the CHO group, 6.2 mmol/L, tended to be lower than the FAST group, 6.9 mmol/L (99{\%} CI for difference, -1.7 to 0.25, P = 0.05) and postoperative beta-cell function, measured by HOMA-beta (impaired beta-cell function at values <100{\%}), tended to be higher in the CHO group, 87{\%}, vs 47.5{\%} in the FAST group (99{\%} CI for difference, -9.4 to 88.4), but these differences were not significant. Adiponectin levels were not different between groups at baseline, and levels of free fatty acid, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein were not affected by treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative carbohydrate loading did not improve postoperative insulin sensitivity. However, the observed postoperative blood glucose levels and beta-cell function as well as secondary outcomes warrant further study to reevaluate traditional fasting practices in surgical patients.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Prolonged preoperative fasting increases postoperative hospital length of stay and current evidence recommends patients drink a carbohydrate-based liquid drink 2 h before surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the addition of hydrolyzed protein to a carbohydrate-based drink would reduce both the inflammatory response and hospital length of stay. METHODS: We evaluated 22 patients of both sexes, undergoing gastrointestinal resection due to cancer. Patients were randomized into two groups: control group (n = 12; 6-8 h fast) and the intervention group (n = 10; fasted to solids for 6 h; and given a beverage containing 11{\%} pea protein hydrolysate and 89{\%} carbohydrates (79{\%} maltodextrin and 21{\%} sucrose), 400 mL the night before and 200 mL 3 h before surgery. Blood samples were collected the morning before surgery and on postoperative day 2. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 4.5{\%} (one case, control group). The duration of postoperative hospital stay was twofold longer in the control group (P = 0.04). A significant increase of serum C-reactive protein/albumin ratio was observed in controls compared with the intervention group (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The abbreviation of preoperative fasting time to 3 h using a solution containing carbohydrates and hydrolyzed pea proteins reduces the acute-phase inflammatory response and decreases the postoperative length of stay in patients undergoing major surgery for a malignancy.},

@article{Lidder2013,
	abstract = {AIM: There is evidence that preoperative carbohydrate drinks and postoperative nutritional supplements improve the outcome of colorectal surgery. There is little information on their individual contribution. METHOD: A prospective four-arm double-blind controlled trial was carried out in which patients were randomized to carbohydrate or placebo drinks preoperatively and a polymeric supplement or placebo drink postoperatively. The primary outcome was insulin resistance (using the short insulin tolerance test and HOMA-IR). Secondary outcomes included handgrip strength, pulmonary function, intestinal permeability and postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were randomized to four demographically well matched groups. Patients who received preoperative and postoperative supplements had better glucose homeostasis (P = 0.004), peak expiratory flow rate (P = 0.035), handgrip strength (P = 0.002) and less insulin resistance (P = 0.001) compared with those who only received placebo drinks. CONCLUSION: Oral nutritional supplements given preoperatively and postoperatively improve postoperative handgrip strength, pulmonary function and insulin resistance. A weaker effect was seen in patients who received supplements either preoperatively or postoperatively. Oral nutritional supplements should be given both preoperatively and postoperatively.},

	abstract = {Recent preanesthetic fasting practice allows patients to take clear fluids up to 2 h before surgery without taking any antacid for the prophylaxis of aspiration pneumonia; this practice is defined as oral rehydration therapy (ORT). It has been reported that with ORT the gastric volume may be significantly lower than that with a standard fasting regimen, although in a standard fasting regimen without preanesthetic antacid, gastric pH and volume values could be critical for causing aspiration pneumonia. In this study we compared gastric fluid status in patients with ORT and those with a standard fasting regimen; patients in both groups received a preanesthetic H(2) antagonist. One hundred and four patients were randomly assigned to either the ORT or standard fasting group, and all were given roxatidine 75 mg 2 h before surgery. After the induction of anesthesia, the gastric contents were collected via a gastric tube to measure gastric volume and pH. Neither gastric volume nor pH differed between the groups (ORT 9.6 +/- 8.2 ml and 5.6 +/- 1.7, respectively, vs. standard fasting 8.5 +/- 6.8 ml and 5.5 +/- 1.7, respectively). These data suggest that ORT may not reduce gastric volume in patients receiving a preanesthetic H(2) antagonist.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the abbreviation of preoperative fasting with a drink containing glutamine and dextrinomaltose improves organic response to surgical trauma. METHODS: Thirty-six female patients adult (18-62 years) candidates for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomly divided into three groups: conventional fasting (fasting group), and two groups receiving two different diets, eight hours (400ml) and two hours before induction of anesthesia (200ml): carbohydrate (CHO) group (12.5{\%} dextrinomaltose) and the glutamine (GLN) group (12.5{\%} dextrinomaltose and 40 and 10g of glutamine, respectively). Blood samples were collected pre and postoperatively. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients completed the study. No pulmonary complication occurred. Gastric residual volume was similar between groups (p = 0.95). Postoperatively, all patients from the fasting group had abnormal glucose (> 110mg/dl), this abnormality being of 50{\%} when compared to the CHO group (p = 0.14), and of 22.2{\%} when compared to the GLN group (p = 0.01). All patients who had the fasting period shortened (CHO + GLN) had normal postoperative insulin, contrasting with 66.7{\%} in the fasted group (p = 0.02). The abnormal sensitivity to insulin postoperatively rose from 32.1{\%} to 46.4{\%} of cases (p = 0.24), and it occurred in only 11.1{\%} of patients in GLN group when compared to 55.5{\%} in the fasting group (p = 0.02).

Fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR index), cortisol, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were assessed before and after surgery (postoperative day (POD) 1, 2, and 3). RESULTS: The administration of OCH resulted in lower fasting glucose, HOMA-IR index, cortisol, and IL-6 on both POD 1 and POD 2. At multivariable regression analyses, the reduction of these parameters was independent of sex, age, body mass index, and major abdominal surgery. Particularly, models including OCH treatment explained 70, 63, and 66 {\%} of the variance of the increase in IL-6 levels at POD 1, POD 2, and POD 3, respectively. The effect of OCH on changes in glucose, insulin resistance, and cortisol on POD 1 and POD 2 disappeared after the inclusion of IL-6 in the models. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with OCH was associated with attenuation of the postoperative metabolic stress response. We hypothesize that modulation of the inflammatory response is one of the mechanisms involved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgery induces insulin resistance that might be alleviated by a nutritional drink given preoperatively. The authors hypothesized that some of the beneficial effects of the drink could be attributed to the volume component (approximately 1 L) rather than to the nutrients. METHODS: Sixty patients scheduled for elective total hip replacement under spinal anesthesia were recruited to a clinical trial, and randomly allocated to preoperative fasting, to oral ingestion of tap water, or to oral ingestion of a carbohydrate drink. An intravenous glucose tolerance test calculated glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity on the day before surgery, in the postoperative ward, and on the day after surgery. Other parameters were stress (cortisol in plasma and urine), muscle catabolism (urinary 3-methylhistidine), and wellbeing. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients completed the study. In the postoperative ward, the glucose clearance and the insulin response had decreased from the previous day by 23{\%} and 36{\%}, respectively. Insulin sensitivity did not decrease until the next morning (-48{\%}) and was due to an increased insulin response (+51{\%}). Cortisol excretion was highest on the day of surgery, while 3-methylhistidine increased 1 day later. Follow-up on the third postoperative day showed an average of 1.5 complications per patient. Wellbeing was better 2 weeks after than before the surgery. None of the measured parameters differed significantly between the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative ingestion of tap water or a nutritional drink had no statistically significant effect on glucose clearance, insulin sensitivity, postoperative complications, or wellbeing in patients undergoing elective hip surgery.},

@article{Harsten2012,
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Perioperative oral carbohydrate intake is beneficial to general surgery patients. Total hip arthroplasty is a common surgical procedure, and even a moderate improvement in patient outcome could have a significant effect on the resources needed for these patients. However, few studies have focused on the effects of carbohydrate intake on orthopaedic patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate if perioperative oral carbohydrate intake alters the postoperative course for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The primary hypothesis was that pain scores would be lower in patients treated with carbohydrate. DESIGN: A randomised, double-blind, controlled trial. SETTING: This study was carried out between September 2009 and April 2011 at a district Swedish hospital that specialises in orthopaedic surgery. PATIENTS: Sixty ASA physical status I-III patients scheduled for elective total hip arthroplasty were included. Exclusion criteria were obesity, diabetes, prior hip surgery to the same hip, ongoing infection, immunological deficiency or age less than 50 or more than 80 years. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were given 400 ml of either an oral 12.5{\%} carbohydrate solution or a placebo beverage (flavoured water) 1.5 h before and 2 h after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analogue scales were used to score six discomfort parameters. RESULTS: Immediately prior to surgery, the carbohydrate-treated patients were less hungry (median score 9.5 vs. 22 mm) and experienced less nausea (0 vs. 1.5 mm) (P< 0.05). Postoperatively, patients in the carbohydrate group experienced less pain at 12, 16 and 20 h (median scores 20, 30 and 34 vs. 7, 5 and 0 mm; P<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study shows that there is limited benefit from administering oral carbohydrate prior to total hip arthroplasty.},

@article{Itou2012,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: In many countries, patients are generally allowed to have clear fluids until 2-3 h before surgery. In Japan, long preoperative fasting is still common practice. To shorten the preoperative fasting period in Japan, we tested the safety and efficacy of oral rehydration therapy until 2 h before surgery. METHODS: Three hundred low-risk patients scheduled for morning surgery in six university-affiliated hospitals were randomly assigned to an oral rehydration solution (ORS) group or to a fasting group. Patients in the ORS group consumed up to 1,000 ml of ORS containing balanced glucose and electrolytes: 500 ml between 2100 the night before surgery and the time they woke up the next morning and 500 ml during the morning of surgery until 2 h before surgery. Patients in the fasting group started fasting at 2100 the night before surgery. Primary endpoints were gastric fluid volume and pH immediately after anesthesia induction. Several physiological measures of hydration and electrolytes including the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and the fractional excretion of urea nitrogen (FEUN) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Mean (SD) gastric fluid volume immediately after anesthesia induction was 15.1 (14.0) ml in the ORS group and 17.5 (23.2) ml in the fasting group (P = 0.30). The mean difference between the ORS group and fasting group was -2.5 ml. The 95{\%} confidence interval ranged from -7.1 to +2.2 ml and did not include the noninferior limit of +8 ml. Mean (SD) gastric fluid pH was 2.1 (1.9) in the ORS group and 2.2 (2.0) in the fasting group (P = 0.59). In the ORS group, mean FENa and FEUN immediately after anesthesia induction were both significantly greater than those in the fasting group (P < 0.001 for both variables). The ORS group reported they had been less thirsty and hungry before surgery (P < 0.001, 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Oral rehydration therapy until 2 h before surgery is safe and feasible in the low-risk Japanese surgical population. Physicians are encouraged to use this practice to maintain the amount of water in the body and electrolytes and to improve the patient's comfort.},

@article{Braga2012,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress due to ischemia/reperfusion injury increases systemic inflammation and impairs immune defenses. Much interest has developed for the administration of antioxidant substrates in surgical patients. The purpose of this study was to perform a pilot evaluation of the impact of a carbohydrate- containing preconditioning oral nutritional supplement (pONS) enriched with glutamine, antioxidants, and green tea extract on postoperative oxidative stress. METHODS: We performed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, involving 36 cancer patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Patients were randomized to receive either pONS or placebo twice the day before surgery and once 3 hours before surgery. Total endogenous antioxidant capacity (TEAC), plasma levels of vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, zinc, F2-isoprostanes, and C-reactive protein were measured at baseline and on postoperative day (POD) 1, 3, and 7. RESULTS: At surgery, the mean gastric residual volume (mL) was 54.2 in the pONS group versus 51.3 in the placebo group (P = NS). On POD 1 plasma levels of vitamin C (P = 0.001), selenium (P = 0.07), and zinc (P = 0.06) were higher in the pONS group compared to placebo. TEAC was improved on POD 1, 3, and 7 in the pONS group compared to placebo (P = 0.01). No difference was found in plasma C-reactive protein levels after surgery in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative pONS administration positively affected plasma vitamin C levels and improved TEAC shortly after surgery, but did not reduce oxidative stress and systemic inflammation markers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prolonged preoperative fasting increases insulin resistance (IR). The authors investigated whether an abbreviated preoperative fast with glutamine (GLN) plus a carbohydrate (CHO)-based beverage would improve the organic response after surgery. METHODS: Forty-eight female patients (19-62 years) were randomized to either standard fasting (control group) or to fasting with 1 of 3 different beverages before video-cholecystectomy. Beverages were consumed 8 hours (400 mL; placebo group: water; GLN group: water with 50 g maltodextrine plus 40 g GLN; and CHO group: water with 50 g maltodextrine) and 2 hours (200 mL; placebo: water; GLN: water with 25 g maltodextrine plus 10 g GLN; and CHO: water with 25 g maltodextrine) before anesthesia. Blood samples were collected pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS: The mean (SEM) postoperative homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance was greater (P < .05) in control patients (4.3 {$[$}1.3{$]$}) than in the other groups (placebo, 1.6 {$[$}0.3{$]$}; CHO, 2.3 {$[$}0.4{$]$}; and GLN, 1.5 {$[$}0.1{$]$}). Glutathione was significantly higher (P < .01) in the GLN group than in both CHO and control groups. Interleukin-6 increased in all groups except the GLN group. The C-reactive protein/albumin ratio was higher (P < .05) in controls than in CHO and GLN groups. The nitrogen balance was less negative in GLN (-2.5 {$[$}0.8{$]$} gN) than in both placebo (-9.0 {$[$}2{$]$} gN; P = .001) and control (-6.6 {$[$}0.4{$]$} gN; P = .04) groups. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative intake of a GLN-enriched CHO beverage appears to improve IR and antioxidant defenses and decreases the inflammatory response after video-cholecystectomy.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Limited information is available about preoperative fasting abbreviation with administration of liquid enriched with carbohydrates (CHO) in cardiovascular surgeries. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clinical variables, security of the method and effects on the metabolism of patients undergoing fasting abbreviation in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. METHODS: Forty patients undergoing CABG were randomized to receive 400 ml (6 hours before) and 200 ml (2 hours before) of maltodextrin at 12.5{\%} (Group I, n=20) or just water (Group II, n=20) before anesthetic induction. Perioperative clinical variables were evaluated. Insulin resistance (IR) was evaluated by Homa-IR index and also by the need of exogenous insulin; pancreatic beta-cell excretory function by Homa-Beta index and glycemic control by tests of capillary glucose. RESULTS: Deaths, bronchoaspiration, mediastinitis, stroke and acute myocardial infarction did not occur. Atrial fibrillation occurred in two patients of each group and infectious complications did not differ among groups (P=0.611). Patients of Group I presented two days less of hospital stay (P=0.025) and one day less in the ICU (P<0.001). The length of time using dobutamine was shorter in Group I (P=0.034). Glycemic control in the first 6h after surgery was worse for Group II (P=0.012). IR was verified and did not differ among groups (P>0.05). A decline in the endogenous production of insulin was observed in both groups (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Preoperative fasting abbreviation with the administration of CHO in the CABG was safe. The glycemic control improved in the ICU; there was less time in the use of dobutamine and length of hospital and ICU stay was reduced. However, neither IR nor morbimortality during hospital phase were influenced.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of carbohydrate-rich drink (CHO) on perioperative discomfort, hemodynamic changes, and insulin response in patients undergoing surgery with spinal anesthesia. METHODS: Forty-four adult patients were assigned to one of the two groups of 22, namely preparation with CHO (CHO group) or fasting from midnight (control group). Ten different discomfort variables, blood glucose and insulin concentrations, and hemodynamic changes were recorded during the perioperative period. RESULTS: Preparation with CHO was effective in reducing hunger, thirst, malaise, unfitness, and, to some extent, anxiety (p < 0.05). Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were increased in the CHO group (p < 0.05). Plasma glucose increased and insulin decreased in the control group (p < 0.05). In the control group, mean arterial pressure was lower compared to the CHO group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preparation with CHO before spinal anesthesia is advantageous due to reducing perioperative discomfort, improving insulin response and stabilizing mean arterial pressure.},

@article{Oyama2011,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: In order to enhance postoperative recovery, preoperative consumption of carbohydrate (CHO) drinks has been used to suppress metabolic fluctuations. Trace elements such as zinc and copper are known to play an important role in postoperative recovery. Here, we examined the effects of preoperatively consuming a CHO drink containing zinc and copper. METHODS: Subjects were 122 elective surgery patients divided into two groups (overnight fasting and CHO groups); each group was further divided into morning or afternoon surgery groups. Subjects in the CHO group consumed 300 mL of a CHO drink the night before surgery, followed by 200 ml before morning surgery or 700 ml before afternoon surgery (> or =2 hours before anesthesia induction). Blood levels of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), retinol-binding protein, zinc, and copper were determined. RESULTS: One subject in the CHO group was excluded after refusing the drink. There were no adverse effects from the CHO drink. NEFA levels increased in the fasting groups. Although zinc levels increased in the CHO group immediately after anesthesia induction, no group differences were observed the day after surgery. CONCLUSION: Preoperative consumption of a CHO drink containing trace elements suppressed preoperative metabolic fluctuations without complications and prevented trace element deficiency. Further beneficial effects during the perioperative period can be expected by adding trace elements to CHO supplements.},

@article{Schmitz2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend preoperative fasting of 2 h for clear fluids, which is often exceeded in routine clinical practice. Existing data on residual gastric volumes in children do not consider fluid intake within <2 h and rely on the aspiration of gastric contents via a gastric tube. This study evaluated the emptying of clear fluids from the stomach using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Healthy volunteers aged 6-14 years were asked to fast overnight. MRI scans to assess gastric volumes were obtained before and immediately after drinking 7 ml kg(-1) of diluted raspberry syrup and then every 30 min up to 120 min. Volumes were determined by a blinded investigator and indexed gastric fluid/air volumes (GFV(w)/GAV(w)) and half-life (t(1/2)) of GFV(w) course after clear fluid intake were calculated. RESULTS: Sixteen children, median age 9.2 (range 6.4-12.8) years, were investigated. Median (range) GFV(w) was 0.62 (0.15-0.97) ml kg(-1) before and 6.68 (4.77-7.78) ml kg(-1) immediately after fluid intake, and 2.92 (0.43-5.04), 1.27 (0.28-3.62), 0.42 (0.07-2.49), and 0.32 (0.04-1.13) ml kg(-1) 30, 60, 90, and 120 min thereafter. Median GFV(w) declined exponentially (t(1/2)=26.1 min). Median individual t(1/2) was 23.6 (range 17.9-47.8) min. GAV(w) showed considerable intra- and inter-individual variation. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy school children, gastric emptying after ingestion of clear fluid occurs with a median half-life time of <30 min but with considerable inter-individual variation.},

@article{Perrone2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prolonged preoperative fasting increases insulin resistance and current evidence recommends carbohydrate (CHO) drinks 2 hours before surgery. Our hypothesis is that the addition of whey protein to a CHO-based drink not only reduces the inflammatory response but also diminish insulin resistance. METHODS: Seventeen patients scheduled to cholecystectomy or inguinal herniorraphy were randomized and given 474 ml and 237 ml of water (CO group) or a drink containing CHO and milk whey protein (CHO-P group) respectively, 6 and 3 hours before operation. Blood samples were collected before surgery and 24 hours afterwards for biochemical assays. The endpoints of the study were the insulin resistance (IR), the prognostic inflammatory and nutritional index (PINI) and the C-reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio. A 5{\%} level for significance was established. RESULTS: There were no anesthetic or postoperative complications. The post-operative IR was lower in the CHO-P group when compared with the CO group (2.75 +/- 0.72 vs 5.74 +/- 1.16; p = 0.03). There was no difference between the two groups in relation to the PINI. The CHO-P group showed a decrease in the both CRP elevation and CRP/albumin ratio (p < 0.05). The proportion of patients who showed CRP/albumin ratio considered normal was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the CHO-P group (87.5{\%}) than in the CO group (33.3{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Shortening the pre-operative fasting using CHO and whey protein is safe and reduces insulin resistance and postoperative acute phase response in elective moderate operations.

@article{Awad2011,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Supplementing preoperative carbohydrate drinks with glutamine may lead to benefits in addition to reducing insulin resistance, but amino acids may delay gastric emptying (GE). The effects of supplementing a preoperative carbohydrate drink (CCD) with glutamine or lipid on GE were studied. METHODS: Ten healthy male volunteers ingested 410 ml of one of three isocaloric-isovolumetric carbohydrate-based drinks labelled with (99m)Tc-DTPA: CCD (preOp((R)), Nutricia, UK, 50 g carbohydrate), CCD/G (preOp((R)), 36 g carbohydrate + 15 g glutamine) or CCD/L (preOp((R)), 36 g carbohydrate + 7 g lipid) in this randomized, blinded, three-way crossover study. After baseline measurements, GE was measured scintigraphically and blood sampled for insulin, glucose and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) at 20 min intervals for 240 min. RESULTS: Mean (95{\%} CI) T(90) GE times for CCD, CCD/G and CCD/L were 101 (87-115), 95 (84-107) and 87 (72-102) min, respectively. At 40 min postprandially, mean (SEM) concentrations of glucose (mmol/l) and insulin (mIU/l) were 7.5 (0.5) and 35 (5) for CCD; 6.2 (0.2) and 28 (4) for CCD/G; and 7 (0.3) and 31 (5) for CCD/L, respectively. There were no differences in postprandial GLP-1 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Glutamine and lipid supplementation did not prolong the GE of CCD but did 'blunt' postprandial glucose and insulin responses, independent of GLP-1 concentrations.

	abstract = {AIM: Preoperative fluid and electrolyte management is usually performed by intravenous therapy. We investigated the safety and effectiveness of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for preoperative fluid and electrolyte management of surgical patients. METHODS: The study consisted of two studies, designed as a prospective observational study. In a pilot study, 20 surgical patients consumed 1000 mL of an oral rehydration solution (ORS) until 2 h before induction of general anesthesia. Parameters such as serum electrolyte concentrations, fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) as an index of renal blood flow, volume of esophageal-pharyngeal fluid and gastric fluid (EPGF), and patient satisfaction with ORT were assessed. In a follow-up study to assess the safety of ORT, 1078 surgical patients, who consumed ORS until 2 h before induction of general anesthesia, were assessed. RESULTS: In the pilot study, water, electrolytes, and carbohydrate were effectively and safely supplied by ORT. The FENa value was increased at 2 h following ORT. The volume of EPGF collected following the induction of anesthesia was 5.3+/-5.6 mL. In the follow-up study, a small amount of vomiting occurred in one patient, and no aspiration occurred in the patients. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ORT is a safe and effective therapy for the preoperative fluid and electrolyte management of selected surgical patients.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: No study so far has tested a beverage containing glutamine 2 h before anesthesia in patients undergoing surgery. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate: 1) the safety of the abbreviation of preoperative fasting to 2 h with a carbohydrate-L-glutamine-rich drink; and 2) the residual gastric volume (RGV) measured after the induction of anesthesia for laparoscopic cholecystectomies. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial with 56 women (42 (17-65) years-old) submitted to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomized to receive either conventional preoperative fasting of 8 hours (fasted group, n = 12) or one of three different beverages drunk in the evening before surgery (400 mL) and 2 hours before the initiation of anesthesia (200 mL). The beverages were water (placebo group, n = 12), 12.5{\%} (240 mOsm/L) maltodextrine (carbohydrate group, n = 12) or the latter in addition to 50 g (40 g in the evening drink and 10 g in the morning drink) of L-glutamine (glutamine group, n = 14). A 20 F nasogastric tube was inserted immediately after the induction of general anesthesia to aspirate and measure the RGV. RESULTS: Fifty patients completed the study. None of the patients had either regurgitation during the induction of anesthesia or postoperative complications. The median (range) of RGV was 6 (0-80) mL. The RGV was similar (p = 0.29) between glutamine group (4.5 {$[$}0-15{$]$} mL), carbohydrate group (7.0 {$[$}0-80{$]$} mL), placebo group (8.5 {$[$}0-50{$]$} mL), and fasted group (5.0 {$[$}0-50{$]$} mL). CONCLUSION: The abbreviation of preoperative fasting to 2 h with carbohydrate and L-glutamine is safe and does not increase the RGV during induction of anesthesia.},

@article{Mathur2010,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major surgery is associated with postoperative insulin resistance which is attenuated by preoperative carbohydrate (CHO) treatment. The effect of this treatment on clinical outcome after major abdominal surgery has not been assessed in a double-blind randomized trial. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery or liver resection were randomized to oral CHO or placebo drinks to be taken on the evening before surgery and 2 h before induction of anaesthesia. Primary outcomes were postoperative length of hospital stay and fatigue measured by visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Sixty-nine and 73 patients were evaluated in the CHO and placebo groups respectively. The groups were well matched with respect to surgical procedure, epidural analgesia, laparoscopic procedures, fasting period before induction and duration of surgery. Postoperative changes in fatigue score from baseline did not differ between the groups. Median (range) hospital stay was 7 (2-35) days in the CHO group and 8 (2-92) days in the placebo group (P = 0.344). For patients not receiving epidural blockade or laparoscopic surgery (20 CHO, 19 placebo), values were 7 (3-11) and 9 (2-48) days respectively (P = 0.054). CONCLUSION: Preoperative CHO treatment did not improve postoperative fatigue or length of hospital stay after major abdominal surgery. A benefit is not ruled out when epidural blockade or laparoscopic procedures are not used. REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN012605000456651 (http://www.anzctr.org.au).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative oral carbohydrate (OCH) reduces postoperative insulin resistance (PIR). This randomized trial investigated whether this effect is related to insulin-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB) signalling pathway. METHODS: Patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for elective open resection were randomly assigned to preoperative OCH, fasting or placebo. Preoperative general well-being, insulin resistance before and immediately after surgery, and postoperative expression of PI3K, PKB, protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in rectus abdominis muscle were evaluated. RESULTS: Patient and operative characteristics did not differ between groups. Subjective well-being was significantly better in OCH and placebo groups than in the fasting group, primarily because of reduced thirst (P = 0.005) and hunger (P = 0.041). PIR was significantly greater in fasting and placebo groups (P < 0.010). By the end of surgery, muscle PTK activity as well as PI3K and PKB levels were significantly increased in the OCH group compared with values in fasting and placebo groups (P < 0.050), but GLUT4 expression was unaffected. CONCLUSION: PIR involves the PI3K/PKB signalling pathway. Preoperative OCH intake improves preoperative subjective feelings of hunger and thirst compared with fasting, while attenuating PIR by stimulation of the PI3K/PKB pathway.},

@article{Protic2010,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative fasting is associated with various untoward postoperative health problems. Previous studies have stressed the advantages of preoperative feeding with a carbohydrate-rich drink 2 hours before surgery; this protocol does not increase the risk of gastric-content aspiration but reduces the level of anxiety and thirstiness during the perioperative period. Spinal anesthesia with the local anesthetic bupivacaine can decrease gastric emptying in the early postoperative period. However, the effect of spinal anesthesia on the gastric emptying rate following preoperative feeding is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of preoperative feeding with a clear carbohydrate-rich drink on gastric emptying early after orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia. METHODS: A total of 110 patients scheduled for semi-elective orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia were included in a randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: group 1 (56 patients) received a standardized 200 ml of clear carbohydrate-enriched drink orally 2 hours before surgery; group 2 (54 patients) acted as a control group with no preoperative feeding. Gastric emptying was evaluated with a paracetamol test at five time points: 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min after administration of paracetamol. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the two groups in paracetamol plasma concentrations or area under the curve during the early postoperative period. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing spinal anesthesia, preoperative feeding 2 hours before surgery had no influence on the gastric emptying rate, indicating that preoperative feeding does not increase the risk of gastric-content aspiration and can be given safely.},

@article{Kaska2010,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Increasing evidence suggests that preoperative fasting, as was the clinical practice for many decades, might be associated with untoward consequences and that a standardized preoperative intake of nutrients might be advantageous; this is a component of the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) concept. Thus, in a randomized controlled trial we compared preoperative fasting with preoperative preparation with either oral or intravenous intake of carbohydrates, minerals and water. Biochemical, psychosomatic, echocardiographic and muscle-power parameters were assessed in surgical patients with colorectal diseases during the short-term perioperative period. We also assessed the safety of peroral intake shortly before surgery. METHODS: A total of 221 elective colorectal surgery patients in this bicentric, randomized, prospective and blinded clinical trial were divided into three groups: A - patients fasting from midnight (control group); B - patients supported preoperatively by glucose, magnesium and potassium administered intravenously; C - patients supported preoperatively by oral consumption of a specifically composed solution (potion). RESULTS: The general perioperative clinical status of patients in groups C and B was significantly better than those in group A. Psychosomatic conditions postoperatively were found to be best in group C (P < 0.029). The rise in the index of insulin resistance (QUICKI) from the preoperative to the postoperative state was significant in group A (P < 0.05). The systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle improved postoperatively in group C vs. group A (P < 0.04), and the ejection fraction was also significantly higher postoperatively in group C vs. group A (P < 0.03). The gastric residual volume was 5 ml and the pH of stomach juice was 3.5-5 in all groups without statistically significant difference. No difference was found in the length of hospital stay or the rate of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative fasting does not confer any benefit or advantage for surgical patients. In contrast, consumption of an appropriate potion composed of water, minerals and carbohydrates offers some protection against surgical trauma in terms of metabolic status, cardiac function and psychosomatic status. Peroral intake shortly before surgery did not increase gastric residual volume and was not associated with any risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Preoperative starvation has many undesirable effects but the minimum length of fasting is limited by gastric emptying, which may be dependent on nutrient content, viscosity and osmolarity of the feed. We compared the gastric emptying of two types of preoperative metabolic preconditioning drinks {$[$}Oral Nutritional Supplement (ONS) (Fresenius Kabi, Germany) and preOp (Nutricia Clinical Care, UK){$]$} in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty (10 male, 10 female) healthy adult volunteers were studied on 3 separate occasions in a randomised crossover manner. Volunteers ingested 400 ml preOp, which is a clear carbohydrate drink (CCD) (50 g carbohydrate, 0 g protein), 70 g ONS (50 g carbohydrate and 15 g glutamine) dissolved in water to a total volume of 400 ml (ONS400) and 300 ml (ONS300). Gastric emptying time was measured using magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Mean (95{\%} CI) T(50) and T(100) gastric emptying times for CCD were significantly lower (p<0.001) compared with ONS400 and ONS300. T(50) was 47 (39-55), 78 (69-87) and 81 (70-92)min for CCD, ONS400 and ONS300 respectively. Correspondingly T(100) was 94 (79-110), 156 (138-173) and 162 (140-184)min. Residual gastric volumes returned to baseline 120 min after CCD and 180 min after ONS400 and ONS300. CONCLUSIONS: The faster gastric emptying for CCD compared to ONS400 and ONS300 signifies that gastric emptying may be more dependent on nutrient load than volume or viscosity in healthy volunteers. While it is safe to give CCD 2h preoperatively, ONS400 and ONS300 should be given at least 3h preoperatively.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies showing the improvement of insulin sensitivity by reducing the term of preoperative fasting are mostly done in patients undergoing major operations. More information about the role of shortened preoperative fasting in perioperative metabolism is needed for such elective minor/moderate abdominal procedures as laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We investigated the influence of a carbohydrate-rich drink given 2 h before laparoscopic cholecystectomy on insulin resistance and the metabolic response to trauma. METHODS: A group of 21 female candidates (18-65 years old) for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to either an 8 h fasting group (control group: n = 10) or to a group receiving 200 ml of a carbohydrate beverage containing 12.5{\%} (25 g, 50 kcal per 100 ml and approximately 285 mOsm) of maltodextrin 2 h before operation (CHO group: n = 11). Blood samples for various biochemical assays were collected both at induction of anesthesia and after the 10th postoperative hour. Insulin resistance was assessed by the HOMA-IR equation (Insulin (microU/ml) x blood glucose (mg/dl)/405). RESULTS: There were no postoperative complications. Seventy percent (7/10) of the controls and 27.3{\%} (3/11) of the CHO group experienced at least one episode of vomiting (RR = 2.42, 95{\%} Confidence Interval {$[$}CI{$]$} = 0.88-6.68; P = 0.08). Biochemical analysis showed that serum glucose (P < 0.01), insulin (P < 0.01), lactate/pyruvate ratio (P = 0.03), and triglycerides (P < 0.01) for the control group were higher than for the CHO group. The value of HOMA-IR was significantly greater (P = 0.03) in the conventionally fasted patients than in the CHO group. CONCLUSIONS: Abbreviation of the period of preoperative fasting and administration of a carbohydrate beverage diminishes insulin resistance and the organic response to trauma.},

@article{Aronsson2009,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In response to surgical stress, the body reacts with a change in metabolism to a catabolic state. This is further aggravated by the fasting state preoperatively. We aimed to determine the effects on catabolism i.e., body composition and IGF-I bioavailability as measured by the serum IGF-I/IGFBP-1 ratio, of a carbohydrate rich drink given shortly before surgery. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients scheduled for a total hip replacement (THR) were randomized in a double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study to a carbohydrate-rich drink or to placebo pre-operatively. The nutritional supplementation consisted of an iso-osmolar carbohydrate-rich drink (12.5 g carbohydrates/100 ml, pH 5.0). Fasting blood samples were collected before surgery and repeated after 5 days and after 2 months. IGF-I and IGFBP-1 were determined in serum by RIA. Body composition was determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). RESULTS: Compared with placebo we found a relative increase in IGF-I bioavailability post-operatively after a carbohydrate-rich drink given shortly before surgery. There were no significant longterm differences in the changes in fat or lean body mass between groups, but, in a subgroup with late scheduled surgery, there was a tendency to a difference (p=0.08) of fat loss after 2 months, with less fat loss in those who received another carbohydrate drink close to surgery. The pre-operative intake of a 200-200 x 2 ml carbohydrate drink was well tolerated and safe. There were no adverse events such as pulmonary aspiration before, during or after operation. CONCLUSIONS: A carbohydrate- rich drink given shortly before surgery increases IGF-I bioavailability post-operatively in patients undergoing a THR, but has no significant effects on body composition after 2 months in physically active people. We suggest that, if the operation is postponed for more than four hours on the same day, an additional carbohydrate drink should be given.},

@article{Helminen2009,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We studied the effect of three different fasting protocols on preoperative discomfort and glucose and insulin levels. METHODS: Two hundred and ten ASA I-III patients undergoing general or gastrointestinal surgery were randomly assigned to three groups: overnight intravenous 5{\%} glucose infusion (1000 ml), carbohydrate-rich drink (400 ml) at 6-7 a.m., or overnight fasting. The subjective feelings of thirst, hunger, mouth dryness, weakness, tiredness, anxiety, headache and pain of each patient were questioned preoperatively using a visual analogue scale. Serum glucose and insulin levels were measured at predetermined time points preoperatively. RESULTS: During the waiting period before surgery, the carbohydrate-rich drink group was less hungry than the fasting group (P = 0.011). No other differences were seen in visual analogue scale scores among the study groups. Trend analysis showed increasing thirst, mouth dryness and anxiety in the intravenous glucose group (P < 0.05). The carbohydrate-rich drink group experienced decreasing thirst but increasing hunger and mouth dryness (P < 0.05). In the fasting group, thirst, hunger, mouth dryness, weakness, tiredness and anxiety increased (P < 0.05). Both intravenous and oral carbohydrate caused a significant increase in glucose and insulin levels. CONCLUSION: Intravenous glucose infusion does not decrease the sense of thirst and hunger as effectively as a carbohydrate-rich drink but does alleviate the feelings of weakness and tiredness compared with fasting.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative carbohydrate (CHO) reduces perioperative insulin resistance and improves preoperative patient comfort. We tested the hypotheses that preoperative CHO reduces the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and improves early postoperative patient comfort. METHODS: Two hundred women scheduled for thyroidectomy were randomly allocated to drink 50 g CHO in 400 ml of water or 0.5 g aspartam in 100 ml of water 2 h before surgery. The incidence and the severity of PONV, pain scores, and analgesic consumption were recorded postoperatively. Intensity of thirst, hunger, anxiety, fatigue were recorded on 100-mm visual analog scales just before the induction of anesthesia, 2, 6, and 24 h postoperatively. RESULTS: The incidence and severity of PONV were similar in both groups. Patients from the CHO group reported significantly less thirst (P = 0.007), hunger (P = 0.04), and fatigue (P = 0.01) than patients from the control group. Postoperative pain scores did not differ significantly between both groups (P = 0.34). However patients from the CHO group requested less acetaminophen during the first 24 postoperative h: 3 g vs. 2 g (median, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Oral carbohydrate before thyroidectomy improves pre- and postoperative patient comfort, as well as postoperative analgesia, but has no effect on the PONV.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-operative insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia are associated with an impaired outcome after surgery. Pre-operative oral carbohydrate loading (CHO) reduces post-operative insulin resistance with a reduced risk of hyperglycaemia during post-operative nutrition. Insulin-resistant diabetic patients have not been given CHO because the effects on pre-operative glycaemia and gastric emptying are unknown. METHODS: Twenty-five patients (45-73 years) with type 2 diabetes {$[$}glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 6.2 +/- 0.2{\%}, mean +/- SEM{$]$} and 10 healthy control subjects (45-72 years) were studied. A carbohydrate-rich drink (400 ml, 12.5{\%}) was given with paracetamol 1.5 g for determination of gastric emptying. RESULTS: Peak glucose was higher in diabetic patients than in healthy subjects (13.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 7.6 +/- 0.5 mM; P<0.01) and occurred later after intake (60 vs. 30 min; P<0.01). Glucose concentrations were back to baseline at 180 vs. 120 min in diabetic patients and healthy subjects, respectively (P<0.01). At 120 min, 10.9 +/- 0.7{\%} and 13.3 +/- 1.2{\%} of paracetamol remained in the stomach in diabetic patients and healthy, subjects respectively. Gastric half-emptying time (T50) occurred at 49.8 +/- 2.2 min in diabetics and at 58.6 +/- 3.7 min in healthy subjects (P<0.05). Neither peak glucose, glucose at 180 min, gastric T50, nor retention at 120 min differed between insulin (HbA1c 6.8 +/- 0.7{\%})- and non-insulin-treated (HbA1c 5.6 +/- 0.4{\%}) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetic patients showed no signs of delayed gastric emptying, suggesting that a carbohydrate-rich drink may be safely administrated 180 min before anaesthesia without risk of hyperglycaemia or aspiration pre-operatively.},

@article{Jarvela2008,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery is a stress that causes insulin resistance, which leads to an increase in insulin requirement. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a pre-operative oral carbohydrate drink vs. overnight fasting on perioperative insulin requirements in non-diabetic patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. METHODS: One hundred and one patients scheduled for CABG were enrolled in the study. After fasting overnight, the patients were randomised into two groups. In the control group (C), no drink was given in the morning. In the treatment group (T), the patients ingested 400 ml of carbohydrate fluid 2 h before induction of anaesthesia. Blood glucose and insulin requirement was recorded. Gastric drainage was measured. Post-operative nausea and vomiting was recorded. RESULTS: Neither the number of patients requiring insulin nor the amount of insulin required to maintain normoglycaemia differed between the study groups. More patients in the treatment group experienced nausea post-operatively (26 vs. 16, P=0.044), but vomiting was equally common in the study groups (10 vs. 7). Intra-operative gastric drainage was 26.8+/-57.9 ml in the treatment group vs. 16+/-37.9 ml in the control group (NS). CONCLUSION: In this study patient population, a pre-operative oral carbohydrate drink did not reduce post-operative insulin resistance or post-operative nausea and vomiting. According to our findings, it is safe to allow cardiac surgery patients to drink clear fluids up to 2 h before induction of anaesthesia, because gastric emptying of the drink was almost total and no aspiration occurred.},

@article{Yagci2008,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite contrary evidence, the practice of overnight fasting before elective surgery maintains its place in tradition. However, prolonged starvation, by its catabolic action, may increase the detrimental effects of surgery. In this study, we evaluated the effects of preoperative carbohydrate loading on the gastric contents of patients and perioperative metabolism. METHODS: Seventy patients scheduled for cholecystectomy or thyroidectomy randomly were assigned to the treatment or control group. Patients in the treatment group (n = 34) received 800 mL of a carbohydrate-rich fluid on the evening before surgery and 400 mL of the same fluid 2 h preoperatively. Conversely, control patients (n = 36) underwent overnight fasting. Plasma glucose and serum insulin levels were obtained across the perioperative period and during anesthesia induction. The volume and pH of preoperative residual gastric contents also were measured. RESULTS: Preoperative plasma glucose levels were found to remain significantly higher in patients who had received the carbohydrate-rich fluid. Serum insulin levels that were elevated initially in the study group returned to control levels by the time of anesthesia induction. There was no statistical difference between the two groups with respect to gastric residue contents or gastric fluid pH. CONCLUSION: The preoperative intake of carbohydrate-rich fluids does not appear to alter the amount or pH of gastric contents, suggesting that this is a safe procedure, in terms of aspiration risk. Furthermore, the intake of such fluid might prevent energy malnutrition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative oral carbohydrate (CHO) reduces postoperative insulin resistance. In this randomized trial, the effect of CHO on postoperative whole-body protein turnover was studied. METHODS: Glucose and protein kinetics ({$[$}6,6(2)H(2){$]$}D-glucose, {$[$}(2)H(5){$]$}phenylalanine, {$[$}(2)H(2){$]$}tyrosine and {$[$}(2)H(4){$]$}tyrosine) and substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry) were studied at baseline and during hyperinsulinaemic normoglycaemic clamping before and on the first day after colorectal resection. Fifteen patients were randomized to receive a preoperative beverage with high (125 mg/ml) or low (25 mg/ml) CHO content. RESULTS: Three patients were excluded after the intervention, leaving six patients in each group. After surgery whole-body protein balance did not change in the high oral CHO group, whereas it was more negative in the low oral CHO group after surgery at baseline (P = 0.003) and during insulin stimulation (P = 0.005). Insulin-stimulated endogenous glucose release was similar before and after surgery in the high oral CHO group, but was higher after surgery in the low oral CHO group (P = 0.013) and compared with the high oral CHO group (P = 0.044). CONCLUSION: Whole-body protein balance and the suppressive effect of insulin on endogenous glucose release are better maintained when patients receive a CHO-rich beverage before surgery.},

We studied effects of preoperative oral carbohydrate loading in elderly patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. DESIGN: Eighteen patients were assigned either to get a carbohydrate drink or to be controls. Perioperatively, glucose was administered. A gastric emptying test was performed. Glucose and insulin concentrations were measured. Levels of glucose, insulin and stress hormones were studied pre-, per- and postoperatively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Preoperative carbohydrate loading did not affect stress hormones. Gastric residual after the carbohydrate drink was 11+/-3{\%} (mean+/-SEM). Glucose concentration was lower before anaesthesia induction in the carbohydrate group, possibly due to increased insulin release. Insulin levels differed at baseline, induction and day six. All patients returned to baseline on day six. CONCLUSIONS: The study group was insulin resistant on postoperative day one and two. The effects were explainable by the traumatic stress response. No adverse effect was noted from the carbohydrate drink. If glucose is administered intravenously during surgery, there is no obvious advantage of preoperative carbohydrate loading on insulin resistance or stress hormone response.},

	abstract = {In this study we investigated the effects of preoperative oral carbohydrate administration on postoperative insulin resistance (PIR), gastric fluid volume, preoperative discomfort, and variables of organ dysfunction in ASA physical status III-IV patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, including those with noninsulin-dependent Type-2 diabetes mellitus. Before surgery, 188 patients were randomized to receive a clear 12.5{\%} carbohydrate drink (CHO), flavored water (placebo), or to fast overnight (control). CHO and placebo were treated in double-blind format and received 800 mL of the corresponding beverage in the evening and 400 mL 2 h before surgery. Patients were monitored from induction of general anesthesia until 24 h postoperatively. Exogenous insulin requirements to control blood glucose levels <or=10.0 mmol/L were used as a marker for PIR. Gastric fluid volume was measured by passive gastric reflux and preoperative discomfort using visual analog scales. Postoperative clinical and surgical data were recorded. Blood glucose levels and insulin requirements did not differ between groups. Patients receiving CHO and placebo were less thirsty compared with controls (P < 0.01 and P = 0.06, respectively). Ingested liquids did not cause increased gastric fluid volume or other adverse events. The CHO group required less intraoperative inotropic support after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass weaning (P < 0.05). In conclusion, preoperative CHO administration before cardiac surgery does not affect PIR. Clear fluids reduce thirst and may be recommended as a safe procedure in ASA III-IV patients. Further research is indicated to investigate possible cardioprotective effects of preoperative CHO intake.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Surgery induces a catabolic response with stress hormone release and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of pre-operative carbohydrate administration on grip strength, gastrointestinal function and hospital stay following elective colorectal surgery. METHODS: Thirty-six patients undergoing elective colonic resection were randomized into one of three groups. Group 1 were fasted; Group 2 were given pre-operative oral water, Group 3 received equivalent volumes of a Maltodextrin drink. Time to first flatus, first bowel movement and hospital stay were recorded. Muscle strength was measured pre-operatively, and on alternate days thereafter until discharge using a grip strength dynamometer. RESULTS: Patients in the carbohydrate group had a median postoperative hospital stay of 7.5 days compared with 13 days in the water group (P > 0.01) and 10 days in the fasted group (P = 0.06). The median time postsurgery to first flatus was 3 days for both the fasted and water groups compared with 1.5 days in the carbohydrate group (P = 0.13). First bowel movement occurred on day 3 in the carbohydrate group, day 4 in the fasting group and day 5 in the water group. The fasted group showed a significant reduction in postoperative grip strength (P < 0.05) with a median drop of 10{\%} at discharge. Neither the water nor the carbohydrate groups showed significant reductions in muscle strength. CONCLUSION: We found that pre-operative administration of oral carbohydrate leads to a significantly reduced postoperative hospital stay, and a trend towards earlier return of gut function when compared with fasting or supplementary water.},

@article{Melis2006,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fasting before surgery is still common care in a lot of western hospitals. Overnight fasting can induce postoperative insulin resistance. Insulin resistance has been shown to be related to infectious morbidity. It was shown that postoperative insulin resistance can be attenuated by preoperative intake of a clear carbohydrate-rich beverage. The aim of this study was to investigate whether preoperative intake of carbohydrate-rich beverages could postoperatively influence the immune system. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled study, we investigated the effect of surgery on the postoperative immune response in 10 preoperatively fasted patients (control) and 2 groups of 10 patients receiving 2 different carbohydrate-rich beverages preoperatively, by measuring human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression on monocytes on the day before and on the day after surgery. Furthermore, we studied perioperative fluid homeostasis and preoperative well-being of the patients. RESULTS: HLA-DR expression decreased significantly after surgery in the control group. Patients receiving any of the 2 carbohydrate-rich beverages did not show this postoperative decrease. Fluid homeostasis was not affected in any of the groups, and well-being tended to be better in patients receiving carbohydrate-rich beverages compared with controls. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that preoperative intake of a carbohydrate-rich beverage can prevent surgery-induced immunodepression and thus might reduce the risk of infectious complications.},

@article{Castillo-Zamora2005,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of clear liquids orally administered at 06:00-06:30 am on the morning of surgery to reduce prolonged preoperative fasting periods. METHODS: After obtaining informed parental consent, 100 children undergoing scheduled orthopedic surgical procedures, ASA I-II, were randomly allocated to two groups. In group 1, children underwent the typical overnight preoperative period and patients in group 2 received a commercial brand of apple juice (glucose 28 g in 250 ml) at 06:00-06:30 am on the day of surgery. Patients <3 years old received 15 ml.kg(-1) and older children 10 ml.kg(-1) to a maximum volume of 250 ml. All patients underwent overnight fasting for milk and solids. RESULTS: Fasting time was 4.8 +/- 2.1 h (ranging from 3 to 11 h) in the group receiving apple juice at 06:00-06:30 am and 13.2 +/- 3.3 h (ranging from 5 to 19 h) in the overnight-fasting group (P < 0.05; 95{\%} CI: -9.6 to -7.4 h). More patients were irritable (odds ratio, OR 4.5; 95{\%} CI: 1.9-10.8) and dehydrated (OR 21.6; 95{\%} CI: 5.9-79.0) in the overnight-fasting group. Glucose levels <2.7 mmol.l(-1) (50 mg.dl(-1)) were not reported in any case. CONCLUSIONS: A 15 ml.kg(-1) of apple juice for patients of <3 years of age or 10 ml.kg(-1) for older children, at 06:00-06:30 am of the surgical morning is a simple procedure to prevent dehydration and to produce positive behavior in low-risk, pediatric surgical patients.},

@article{Hausel2005,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A carbohydrate-rich drink (CHO) has been shown to reduce preoperative discomfort. It was hypothesized that it may also reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). METHODS: Patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy under inhalational anaesthesia (127 women and 45 men; mean(s.d.) 48(15) years) were randomized to either preoperative fasting, intake of CHO (50 kcal/100 ml, 290 mOsm/kg) or placebo. The non-fasting groups were double-blinded; patients ingested 800 ml of liquid on the evening before surgery and 400 ml 2 h before anaesthesia. Nausea and pain scores on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and episodes of PONV were recorded up to 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: The incidence of PONV was lower in the CHO than in the fasted group between 12 and 24 h after surgery (P = 0.039). Nausea scores in the fasted and placebo groups were higher after operation than before admission to hospital (P = 0.018 and P < 0.001 respectively), whereas there was no significant change in the CHO group. No intergroup differences in VAS scores were seen. The use of anaesthetics, opioids, antiemetics and intravenous fluids was similar in all groups. CONCLUSION: CHO may have a beneficial effect on PONV 12-24 h after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

	abstract = {AIM: Recent evidence suggests that the provision of energy-containing fluids is safe and may impact positively on markers of recovery. The aims of this study were to assess the tolerance of preoperative carbohydrate fluid administration and to determine its effect on postoperative metabolic and clinical responses. METHODS: Patients admitted to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh for major, elective abdominal surgery were recruited to this double-blind, randomised study and received either a placebo drink or carbohydrate (12.6g/100ml) drink (CHOD). Patients consumed 800 ml of their drink on the evening before surgery and 400 ml on the day of surgery 2-3 h before the induction of anaesthesia. Nutritional status was determined using body mass index (BMI) and upper arm anthropometry; all measurements were taken preoperatively, postoperatively and at discharge. Blood glucose and insulin concentrations were also measured preoperatively and on the first post operative day. Length of hospital stay (LOS) and postoperative complications were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were recruited and 65 (34 male:31 female) completed this study. Thirty-four patients were randomised to receive the placebo drink (control group) and 31 patients to receive the carbohydrate drink (CHOD group). Groups were well-matched in terms of gender and age. There were no differences between the two groups at baseline for BMI (control: -25.1+/-1.7 kg/m2; CHOD -25.2+/-1.2 kg/m2), upper arm anthropometry or surgical procedure. At discharge loss of muscle mass (arm muscle circumference) was significantly greater in the control group when compared with the CHOD group (control: -1.1+/-0.15 cm; CHOD: -0.5+/-0.16 cm; P<0.05). Baseline insulin (control: 20.7+/-4.9 mU/l; CHOD: 24.6+/-6.2 mU/l) and glucose (control: 6.0+/-1.4 mmol/l; CHOD 5.7+/-1.4 mmol/l) were comparable in the two groups and did not differ postoperatively. No complications were recorded as a result of preoperative fluid consumption. Postoperative morbidity occurred in six patients from each group. Median LOS in the control group was 10 days (IQR=6), and 8 days (IQR=4) in the CHOD group. CONCLUSION: Preoperative consumption of carbohydrate-containing fluids is safe. Provision of a carbohydrate energy source prior to surgery may attenuate depletion of muscle mass after surgery. Further studies are required to determine if this preservation of muscle mass is reflected in improved function and reduced rehabilitation time.},

@article{Soop2004,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Postoperative metabolism is characterised by insulin resistance and a negative whole-body nitrogen balance. Preoperative carbohydrate treatment reduces insulin resistance in the first day after surgery. We hypothesised that preoperative oral carbohydrate treatment attenuates insulin resistance and improves whole-body nitrogen balance 3 days after surgery. METHODS: Fourteen patients undergoing total hip replacement were double-blindly randomised to preoperative oral carbohydrate treatment (12.5{\%}, 800 + 400 ml, n = 8) or placebo (n = 6). Glucose kinetics (6,6-D2-glucose), substrate utilisation (indirect calorimetry) and insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp) were measured preoperatively and on the third day after surgery. Nitrogen losses were monitored for 3 days after surgery. Values are mean (SEM). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistics were used. RESULTS: Endogenous glucose release during insulin infusion increased after surgery in the placebo group. Preoperative carbohydrate treatment, as compared to placebo, significantly attenuated postoperative endogenous glucose release (0.69 (0.07) vs. 1.21 (0.13)mg kg(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.01), while whole-body glucose disposal and nitrogen balance were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: While insulin resistance in the first day after surgery has previously been characterised by reduced glucose disposal, enhanced endogenous glucose release was the main component of postoperative insulin resistance on the third postoperative day. Preoperative carbohydrate treatment attenuated endogenous glucose release on the third postoperative day.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative oral carbohydrate can attenuate postoperative insulin resistance and catabolism, and may have the potential to improve postoperative recovery. There are no data from randomized studies on postoperative clinical outcome after specific surgical procedures. This study evaluated the clinical effects of a preoperative carbohydrate beverage in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: Ninety-four patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were included in a randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive 800 ml of an iso-osmolar 12.5 per cent carbohydrate-rich beverage the evening before operation (100 g carbohydrate) and another 400 ml (50 g carbohydrate) 2 h before initiation of anaesthesia, or the same volume of a placebo beverage. The primary endpoint was general well-being the day after operation. Patients were evaluated from 5 days before to 5 days after operation. Daily scores of general well-being, fatigue, appetite and pain, computerized measurements of physical activity and sleep (actigraphy), and subjective sleep quality were recorded. Nausea and vomiting were assessed twice within the first 24 h after surgery. RESULTS: Data from 86 patients were available for statistical analysis, 43 in each treatment group. No significant intergroup differences in general well-being or any other outcome variable were found. CONCLUSION: A preoperative carbohydrate beverage did not improve clinical outcome after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgery is succeeded by long-lasting state of relative peripheral insulin resistance, which is reduced by giving glucose infusion or oral carbohydrate-rich drinks immediate before operating instead of fasting. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether oral carbohydrate or carbohydrate with peptide drinks preoperatively instead of fasting would improve postoperative voluntary muscle strength, nutritional intake and ambulation, decrease postoperative fatigue, anxiety and discomfort, and reduce the endocrine response to surgery. METHODS: Forty-eight patients were included and randomized into three groups to receive 2 x 400 ml of carbohydrate-rich drinks or to fast overnight and allowed only water. Voluntary grip and quadriceps strength, body composition, pulmonary function, VAS-score of eight parameters of wellbeing, muscle biopsies and insulin, glucagon, IGF-1 and free fatty acids were measured before and after the operation. The basic postoperative regimen for all groups were immediate oral nutrition and early enforced mobilization. RESULTS: Significant postoperative decrease in glycogen synthase activity in the muscle biopsies was reduced in the intervention groups, and in combination, the intervention groups had a less reduced quadriceps strength after one week (-10{\%} vs. -16{\%}, NS) and one month (-5{\%} vs. -13{\%}, P < 0.05). Minor changes in the endocrine response to surgery were found without differences between the groups, and there were no differences between the groups in ambulation time, nutritional intake or subjective measures of wellbeing.},

@article{Hausel2001,
	abstract = {UNLABELLED: We studied the effects of different preoperative oral fluid protocols on preoperative discomfort, residual gastric fluid volumes, and gastric acidity. Two-hundred-fifty-two elective abdominal surgery patients (ASA physical status I-II) were randomized to preparation with a 12.5{\%} carbohydrate drink (CHO), placebo (flavored water), or overnight fasting. The CHO and Placebo groups were double-blinded and were given 800 mL to drink on the evening before and 400 mL on the morning of surgery. Visual analog scales were used to score 11 different discomfort variables. CHO did not increase gastric fluid volumes or affect acidity, and there were no adverse events. The visual analog scale scores in a control situation were not different between groups. During the waiting period before surgery, the CHO-treated group was less hungry and less anxious than both the other groups (P < or = 0.05). CHO reduced thirst as effectively as placebo (P < 0.0001 versus Fasted). Trend analysis showed consistently decreasing thirst, hunger, anxiety, malaise, and unfitness in the CHO group (P < 0.05). The Placebo group experienced decreasing unfitness and malaise, whereas nausea, tiredness, and inability to concentrate increased (P < 0.05). In the Fasted group, hunger, thirst, tiredness, weakness, and inability to concentrate increased (P < 0.05). In conclusion, CHO significantly reduces preoperative discomfort without adversely affecting gastric contents. IMPLICATIONS: Discomfort during the period of waiting before elective surgery can be reduced if patients are prepared with a carbohydrate-rich drink, compared with preoperative oral intake of water or overnight fasting. Visual analog scales can provide useful information about preoperative discomfort in elective surgery patients.},

	abstract = {Postoperative insulin resistance is a well-characterized metabolic state that has been shown to correlate with the length of postoperative stay in hospital. Preoperative intravenous or oral carbohydrate treatment has been shown to attenuate the development of postoperative insulin resistance measured 1 day after surgery. To study the effects of preoperative oral carbohydrate treatment on postoperative changes in insulin resistance and substrate utilization, in the absence of postoperative confounding factors, 15 patients were double-blindly treated with either a carbohydrate-rich beverage (12.5{\%}) (n = 8) or placebo (n = 7) before undergoing total hip replacement surgery. Insulin sensitivity, endogenous glucose release, and substrate oxidation rates were measured before and immediately after surgery. Whole body insulin sensitivity decreased by 18{\%} in the treatment group vs. 43{\%} in the placebo group (P < 0.05, Student's t-test for unpaired data). In both groups, the major mechanism of insulin resistance was an inhibition of insulin-induced nonoxidative glucose disposal after surgery. The better preservation of insulin sensitivity in the treatment group was attributable to a less reduced glucose disposal in peripheral tissues and increased glucose oxidation rates.},

@article{Moyao-Garcia2001,
	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of an oral isosmolar solution of electrolytes (ISE) administered to interrupt a prolonged fasting period in children undergoing an elective surgical procedure under general anesthesia. METHODS: Forty unpremedicated children aged 3 to 12 years, ASA I, undergoing a surgical procedure requiring general anesthesia were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 groups. Group 1 consisted of patients with an overnight fasting period for milk and solids of at least 8 hours. In group 2, patients under a similar fasting period received a volume of 4 mL/kg of an oral ISE 3 hours before completing the fasting period. After anesthetic induction, blood glucose level (BGL) was quantified, and patients underwent an endoscopic examination to obtain the gastric content to determine the residual gastric volume (RGV) and pH levels. RESULTS: In group 1, the RGV was 0.78 +/- 0.44 mL/kg, pH was 1.75 +/- 0.38, and BGL was 86.4 +/- 14.5. In group 2, the RGV was 0.40 +/- 0.29 mL/kg, pH was 3.18 +/- 0.61, and BGL was 85.1 +/- 12.6. Only RGV and pH were significantly different between groups. CONCLUSION: A prolonged fasting period interrupted with oral ISE administration resulted in an RGV of low risk, without counterbalancing a potential fasting-induced hypoglycemia.},

@article{Blum2019,
	abstract = {Background: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal, standardized approach to the surgical patient that incorporates evidenced-based interventions designed to achieve rapid recovery after surgery by minimizing the patient's stress response. One aspect of ERAS, carbohydrate loading, has been shown in multiple randomized controlled trials to result in postoperative benefits in patients undergoing colorectal surgery, but there appears to be insufficient data to make definitive recommendations for or against carbohydrate loading in joint replacement patients. Objective: To evaluate postoperative nausea and length of stay (LOS) after a preoperative carbohydrate loading protocol was initiated for patients undergoing total joint replacement. Design: Retrospective chart review. Setting and participants: 100 patients who underwent either total knee or hip arthroplasty at Winthrop University Hospital, Mineola, NY, in the past 4 years and either had (n = 50) or had not received preoperative carbohydrate supplements (n = 50). Methods: Using the total joint database, the medical record was reviewed for the patient's demographics, LOS, documentation of postoperative nausea, and number of doses of antiemetic medication given to the patient. Results: The mean LOS for the carbohydrate-loading group and non-carbohydrate group was 1.9 days and 2.6 days. respectively, a difference of 0.70 days (P < 0.0001). The carbohydrate-loaded group received a total of 13 doses of antiemetic medications and the non-carbohydrate group received 21 doses. The average number of antiemetic doses given to a patient postoperatively was 0.26 for the carbohydrate-loaded group and 0.42 for the non-carbohydrate-loaded group. The difference was 0.16 doses (P < 0.7815). Conclusion: The implementation of carbohydrate loading decreased LOS for joint replacement patients by approximately 1 day. Additionally, there was a trend towards decreased antiemetic use and fewer documented cases of postoperative nausea after carbohydrate loading.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative fasting may lead to undesirable effects in the surgical patient in whom there is a stimulus to ingesting clear liquids until 2hours before anesthesia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastric emptying of two different solutions using ultrasound. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, blind study, 34 healthy volunteers ingested 200mL of two solutions without residues in two steps: an isotonic solution with carbohydrates, electrolytes, osmolarity of 292 mOsm.L(-1), and 36 kcal; and other nutritional supplementation with carbohydrates, proteins, electrolytes, osmolarity of 680 mO.L(-1), and 300 kcal. After 2hours, a gastric ultrasound was performed to assess the antrum area and gastric volume, and the relation of gastric volume to weight (vol.w(-1)), whose value above 1.5mL.kg(-1) was considered a risk for bronchoaspiration. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between all parameters evaluated 2hours after the ingestion of nutritional supplementation compared to fasting. The same occurred when the parameters between isotonic solution and nutritional supplementation were compared 2hours after ingestion. Only one patient had vol.w(-1) <1.5mL.kg(-1) 2hours after ingestion of nutritional supplementation; and only one had vol.w(-1)> 1.5mL.kg(-1) after ingestion of isotonic solution. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that gastric emptying of equal volumes of different solutions depends on their constitution. Those with high caloric and high osmolarity, and with proteins present, 2hours after ingestion, increased the gastric volumes, which is compatible with the risk of gastric aspiration.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of preoperative fasting abbreviation with a carbohydrate and protein-enriched solution, on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) incidence in gynecological surgery patients, a population naturally at risk for such unpleasant episodes. METHODS: The present prospective double-blind randomized study was performed at The Hospital Municipal e Maternidade Dr. Odelmo Leao Carneiro (HMMOLC, in the Portuguese acronym), in Uberlandia, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in partnership with the Gynecology Department of the Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of UNIFESP and the board of HMMOLC, and included in the Brazil Platform and in the Brazilian Clinical Trial Registry. After signing the consent form, 80 women, who were submitted to gynecological surgery in the period from January to June 2016, were randomized into 2 groups: control group (n = 42) and juice group (n = 38). They received, respectively, 200 mL of inert solution or liquid enriched with carbohydrate and protein 4 hours presurgery. The incidence, frequency and intensity of PONV were studied using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with statistical analysis performed by the software IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). RESULTS: The incidence of nausea and vomiting was lower than in the literature, to this population, with 18.9{\%} (14/74) for the control group and 10.8{\%} (8/74) for the juice group, respectively, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSION: The incidence of nausea and vomiting was lower than in the literature, but it cannot be said that this is due to the abbreviation of fasting. It can provide greater comfort, with the possibility of PONV prevention in patients at risk for these episodes.},

Methods: 60 patients with gastric cancer scheduled were randomly divided into preoperative oral carbohydrate or placebo drink. Preoperative general well-being, 2-3 hours before the induction of anesthesia all patients received either a placebo drink or carbohydrate drink, blood glucose, insulin were measured before and immediately after surgery, Insulin resistance index was calculated using Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA), and postoperative complications and length of hospital stay were respectively recorded. Results: No complications associated with anesthesia were recorded as a result of preoperative fluid consumption. In the two groups, blood glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR immediately postoperative in the preoperative oral carbohydrate group were significantly lower than those in the preoperative oral placebo group. Insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was reduced in both groups; the oral carbohydrate group was higher than oral placebo group. There were no differences between two groups on length of hospital stay. Conclusion: Preoperative consumption of carbohydrate-containing fluid is safe. Preoperative oral carbohydrate may alleviate the postoperative immediately insulin resistance should be a routine for preoperative preparation. {\copyright}2012 Yang Y, et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Intake of clear liquids 2 h preoperatively is recommended by many anesthesiology societies. A novel carbohydrate-rich drink (CHO) has been developed for this purpose; however its effects on gastric empty and fasting discomfort have not yet been elucidated. The present study examined the effects of this CHO on gastric emp-tying and fasting discomfort in healthy volunteers. Methods: Thirty healthy volunteers received 400 mL CHO or 10{\%} glucose solution after fasting overnight for at least 8 hours. Each participant randomly ingested one drink and one week later took the other drink. Gastric emptying was examined via ultrasonography of cross-sectional areas (CSA) of the gastric antrum. The degrees of hunger, thirst, and mouth dryness were recorded over 180 minutes shortly before and after fluid intake. Results: Gastric CSA immediately increased after the ingestion of the CHO or glucose solution and returned to baseline by 60 min after ingestion (P > 0.05 vs 0 min). There were no differences in gastric CSA when comparing intake of the CHO and glucose solutions. Thirst and hunger were relieved at the time points measured after ingestion of both solutions vs before ingestion (P < 0.01). However, mouth dryness was still relieved 180 minutes after intake of the CHO, whereas the glucose solution had no such effect. Conclusion: Rapid gastric emptying and relief of fasting discomfort occurred with intake of both the glucose and the new CHO solutions. Thus, intake of the new CHO solution 2 hours preoperatively appears to be safe prior to anesthesia.},

	abstract = {Background: Overnight fasting before surgery used to be the routine. Overnight fasting changes patients'metabolic state and influences their perioperative stress response. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of preoperative carbohydrate drinks on return of bowel sounds and movement, postoperative complications, and length of stay. Methods: It is a prospective non-randomized study with 196 consecutive patients who underwent surgery in Vsetin hospital for a diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer from January 2010 to January 2015. Patients were assigned into two groups --with (PreOp group) and without (Non-PreOp group) carbohydrate drink. We collected data regarding age, comorbidities, local stage of tumor, urgency and type of operation. The output variables recorded included postoperative bowel sounds, first stool, postoperative complications, anastomotic leak, surgical site infections, and length of hospital stay. Results: In the PreOp group there was faster return of peristalsis (p = 0,033). We did not prove that the PreOp influenced passage of stool. The total number of postoperative complications was higher in the Non-PreOp group than in the PreOp group, 57 (57{\%}) vs. 30 (31{\%}) respectively, (p = 0,0003). The most frequent type of complication was surgical site infection (SSI). It occurred in 17{\%} in the PreOp group and in 34{\%} in the Non-PreOp group (p = 0,004). The difference in anastomotic leak rate was not significant. Mean hospital stay was 13 days in the PreOp group and 16 days in the Non-PreOp group (p = 0,006). Conclusion: Use of carbohydrate solution before the surgery accelerates return of bowel sounds, reduces total number of postoperative complications, SSI and shortens the length of hospital stay. Carbohydrate beverages should be used more widely in daily practice.},

@article{Weledji2017,
	abstract = {Background The stress response to surgery involves catabolism and gluconeogenesis resulting in postoperative hyperglycaemia. Postoperative hyperglycaemia is a risk factor for postoperative complications and preoperative fasting further aggravates this response. A carbohydrate (CHO) drink instead of fasting is expected to decrease insulin resistance and reduce post-operative hyperglycaemia. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the reduction of the pre-operative fasting period on post-operative hyperglycaemia and post-operative complications in open surgery. Methods A hospital-based prospective case control study of 70 patients scheduled for elective surgery were sampled to either a case (carbohydrate-loaded) or a control (FAST) group. Postoperative hyperglycaemia and complications were the primary and secondary outcomes respectively reported. Results 70 patients were recruited with 35 patients per group. 40 (57{\%}) were females. The mean blood glucose on the first postoperative day was significantly higher in those who fasted (146.20 $\pm$38.36 mg/dl) than in those who received the energy drink (123.06 $\pm$26.64 mg/dl), p = 0.004. Postoperative infections were significantly higher in the control group than in the CHO group (31.43{\%}; and 8.57{\%}; 95{\%} C.I: 1.23--19.47) p = 0.033. The mean length of hospital stay was longer in the FAST (12.54days $\pm$15.08) than in the CHO (9.17days $\pm$12.65) group although the difference was not statistically significant p = 0.315. The mean age, surgery type and mean duration of surgery were significant between groups but not upon logistic regression for significant clinical and demographic variables. Conclusion Preoperative CHO loading is effective and safe in reducing post-operative hyperglycaemia and infection in open general surgery even in a low resource setting.},

@article{Bisinotto2017,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The current preoperative fasting guidelines allow fluid intake up to 2hours before surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastric volume of volunteers after an overnight fast and compare it with the gastric volume 2hours after ingestion of 200 and 500mL of isotonic solution, by means of ultrasound assessment. METHOD: Eighty volunteers underwent gastric ultrasound at three times: after 8hours of fasting; 2hours after ingestion of 200mL isotonic saline, followed by the first scan; and on another day, 2hours after ingestion of 500mL of the same solution after an overnight fast. The evaluation was quantitative (antrum area and gastric volume, and the ratio of participants' gastric volume/weight) and qualitative (absence or presence of gastric contents on right lateral decubitus and supine positions. A p-value<0.05 was considered significant). RESULTS: There was no difference in quantitative variables at measurement times (p>0.05). Five volunteers (6.25{\%}) had a volume/weight over 1.5mL.kg(-1) at fasting and 2hours after ingestion of 200mL and 6 (7.5{\%}) after 500mL. Qualitatively, the presence of gastric fluid occurred in more volunteers after fluid ingestion, especially 500mL (18.7{\%}), although not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound assessment of gastric volume showed no significant difference, both qualitative and quantitative, 2h after ingestion of 200mL or 500mL of isotonic solution compared to fasting, although gastric fluid content has been identified in more volunteers, especially after ingestion of 500mL isotonic solution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Guidelines recommend a clear liquid fasting time of 2 h before surgery, which is often exceeded, leading to adverse reactions (ARs) such as discomfort, thirst, and dehydration. We assessed the gastric contents and ARs after oral glucose water administration 1 h prior to surgery in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD). MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial of children with CCHD enrolled at the Fujian Medical University Union Hospital from 09/2014 to 05/2017 and randomized to receive oral glucose water (10 g of glucose in 100 ml of warm water, 5 ml/kg) 2 h (2-h group, n=174) or 1 h (1-h group, n=170) before surgery. The primary endpoint was gastric volume. Secondary endpoints included pH of gastric content, preoperative blood glucose, and risk factors for aspiration pneumonia. Pre- and intraoperative ARs were recorded. RESULTS The 1-h group showed smaller gastric content volumes (0.34+/-0.35 (95{\%} CI: 0.29-0.39) vs. 0.43+/-0.33 (95{\%} CI: 0.38-0.48) ml/kg, t=2.55, P<0.05) and higher blood glucose (6.21+/-0.78 (95{\%} CI: 6.09-6.33) vs. 5.59+/-1.11 (95{\%} CI: 5.43-5.76) mmol/L, t=-5.91, P<0.001). The 95{\%} confidence interval of the volume difference between the 2 groups was 0.017-0.163, the upper limit value was 0.163 <delta=0.2 (P<0.01). The non-inferiority hypothesis was correct. The 1-h group showed lower incidence of crying, thirst and hypoxia (all P<0.05 vs. 2-h group). There were no differences in ARs between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS A 1-h fast prior to surgery was not inferior to a 2-h fast in terms of gastric residuals and ARs in pediatric patients with CCHD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the metabolic/inflammatory impact of reducing the preoperative fasting time in preschool children. METHODS: Forty children were randomly assigned to a fasting group (absolute fasting after 00:00) and a carbohydrate (CHO) group (allowed to ingest, two hours before surgery, a carbohydrate-rich beverage). Blood samples were collected right before and after surgery to quantify the levels of albumin, interleukin-6, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein and to calculate insulin resistance by the HOMA-IR index. RESULTS: Preoperative fasting time in the CHO group were shorter than in the fasting group (2.49h vs. 11.24h, p <0.001). Pre- and post-surgical CRP levels were significantly lower in the CHO group (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively). The preoperative CRP/albumin ratios in the CHO group were lower than in the fasting group (p = 0.03). Four patients (21{\%}) in the fasting group but none in the CHO group were hyperglycemic before surgery (p = 0.04). The two groups had similar levels of albumin, interleukin-6, insulin and HOMA index. There were no adverse events. CONCLUSION: Reducing the preoperative fasting time with carbohydrate-rich beverages improves the perioperative metabolic and inflammatory responses of preschool children undergoing inguinal hernia surgery.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Perioperative aspiration of gastric contents is a rare but serious complication of anaesthesia. Recent fasting guidelines recommend 2 h of fasting for clear fluids before surgery, to avoid aspiration but are often over looked in clinical practice. Our aim is to overcome these issues by using ultrasound to quantify gastric volume as our primary objective. Patients with ASA grade I with age group between 18 and 60 years undergoing elective surgery with general anaesthesia requiring tracheal intubation were randomized in overnight fasting group (group A) and 2-h fasting group with 200 ml of clear apple juice (group B). Ultrasound-guided gastric volume was calculated preoperatively, and gastric pH was measured immediately post-tracheal intubation using pH strip paper. In a total of 60 patients, the mean gastric volume by USG in group A is 29.7 $\pm$8.0 ml and group B is 19.2 $\pm$4.9 ml. The reduced gastric volume in group B is statistically significant (< 0.00001). The mean pH of gastric aspirate in group A is 1.4, and group B is 1.6 with statistically insignificant p value (p < 0.1268) which shows that pH in both the groups was almost same. The mean gastric volume in patients who had 200 ml of clear apple juice 2 h prior (group B) to non-abdominal surgery was lesser than patients who fasted overnight (group A). It supports the fasting guidelines which help in reducing the preoperative discomfort of long fasting hours and dehydration of patients, whereas the mean pH was almost the same for both the groups.
